<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Since the first publication of <i>Custom and Myth</i>, many
other works have appeared, dealing on the same principles
with matters of belief, fable and ritual. Were
the book to be re-written, numerous fresh pieces of
evidence might be adduced in support of its conclusions.
In Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s <i>Golden Bough</i> (Macmillan)
the student will find a carefully conceived argument,
and a large collection of testimonies, bearing on the
wide diffusion, among savages and civilised peoples,
of ancient rites and ancient ideas. The works of
Mannhardt have practically been introduced to the
English reader by Mr. Frazer, with much new matter
of his own. The main topics are the worship of
human gods and the superstitions connected with
vegetation. To push a theory too far is the common
temptation of mythologists, and perhaps Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s
cornstalk does rather threaten to overshadow the
whole earth and exclude the light of sun and sky.
But the reader, whatever his opinions, will find
great pleasure and profit in Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s remarkable
studies, and in those of Mannhardt, which were
unknown to myself when I wrote <i>Custom and Myth</i>.</p>

<p>In Miss Harrison&rsquo;s volume on Athenian Myths
the student will find the &aelig;tiological theory (namely,
that many myths were invented to explain obscure
points of ritual) applied in a number of classical
instances. A singularly ingenious study of Roman
myths is presented in Mr. Jevons&rsquo;s edition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>viii]</a></span>
Plutarch&rsquo;s <i>Romaine Questions</i> (Nutt). These are recent
instances of the use of the &lsquo;anthropological&rsquo;
method, first firmly established by Mr. Tylor&rsquo;s
<i>Primitive Culture</i>, and now holding its own as a
recognised instrument in the study of the historical
development of the imagination. In Rosscher&rsquo;s
<i>Ausf&uuml;hrliches Lexikon</i> of Greek and Roman mythology,
the earlier method of the philologists is
usually adopted, and the work, still in course of
publication, is most useful for its recondite learning.</p>

<p>These notes are meant for the guidance of any
reader who may care to push his studies further
than the sketches of the present volume.</p>

<p>On one or two points some remarks may be necessary.
The author has been not unnaturally accused
of seeing Totems everywhere. He would therefore
protest that he does not regard every beast and bird
which appears in myths or in religious art as necessarily
a Totem. But he inclines to think that where
Celts or Greeks claim descent from a god who
pursued his amours in animal shape, or where a
tribe bears the name of an animal, regards that
animal with religious respect, and places its effigy
beside that of a god, the Totemistic hypothesis
colligates the phenomena, and deserves consideration.
These and other early features of religion
occur mainly in Greece after the Homeric age. It
has been suggested, for example, by Mr. Walter
Leaf, that Homer&rsquo;s people, the Ach&aelig;ans, were free
from all such ideas as Totemism, worship of the dead,
ritual of purification for homicide, the mysteries, and
so forth. These were notions held by the Pelasgi,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>ix]</a></span>
and revived or retained by the Ionians, an older and
distinct stock of Pelasgian origin. I am unable to
convince myself in this matter, not knowing how
much of the refinement in the Homeric poems is due
to the genius of the poet, who might ignore practices
with which he was familiar. They may have been
Pelasgo-Ionians, who derived Helen&rsquo;s birth from the
Swan, or Homer may have chosen to slur over an
Ach&aelig;an legend, and so on in other cases; for
example, as to the descent of the Myrmidons from
Zeus in the shape of an Ant. On another point a
word may be said. One has been accused of believing
that identical popular tales, the same incident
in the same sequence of plot, might arise simultaneously
in savage imaginations in all parts of the
world. In <i>Custom and Myth</i> it will be plain that I
say nothing of the sort. &lsquo;The Far-Travelled Tale&rsquo;
is one instance chosen to show that such a story must
probably have drifted, somehow, round the world. On
the other hand, in &lsquo;Cupid and Psyche,&rsquo; it is asserted
that <em>the central incident</em> might be invented wherever
the nuptial taboo on which it is based was recognised.
The exact sequence of incidents in the &lsquo;Cupid and
Psyche&rsquo; of Apuleius, on the other hand, could probably
only be invented once for all. But we find the
central incident where we do not find the sequence
of incidents which make up &lsquo;Cupid and Psyche.&rsquo; A
full statement of my ideas is prefixed to Miss
Roalfe Cox&rsquo;s <i>Cinderella</i> (Folklore Society). As a
rule, the incidents in <i>M&auml;rchen</i> are common to all
races; an artistic combination of many of these in a
plot must probably be due to a single imagination,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>x]</a></span>
and the plot must have been diffused in the ways
described in <i>Custom and Myth</i>. Independently
evolved myths may closely resemble each other
when they account for some natural phenomenon, or
are based on some common custom. Wherever a
sequence of such incidents is found in a distinct and
artistic plot, we may provisionally assign diffusion
from an original centre as that cause. Singular as
are the coincidences of fancy, it is unlikely that they
ever produced <em>exactly</em> the same tale in lands which
have never been in communication with each other.
I am unable to conjecture why Mr. Jacobs, M.
Cosquin, and probably other critics, regard me as
maintaining that all similar tales in all countries
have been independently evolved. I have always
allowed for the possibility both of diffusion and, to
a certain extent, of coincidence, as in the Red Indian
forms of &lsquo;Cupid and Psyche&rsquo; and of &lsquo;The Dead
Bride,&rsquo; a shape of the story of Eurydice. Discussion
would be simpler, if controversialists took the trouble
to understand each other.</p>

<p>In the Report of the Folklore Congress of 1891
(p. 65) I find that I said &lsquo;the suggestion that
exactly the same plot, in exactly the same shape,
and with exactly the same incidents, can have been
invented by several persons independently, seems to
me inconceivable,&rsquo; and on p. 74 I find M. Cosquin
alleging that my opinion is the very reverse, followed
by Mr. Jacobs (p. 85). I have tried to explain that
I believe in no such exact coincidences of imagination,
though how far precisely coincidence may go is a
delicate question.</p>

<h2 class="padtop"><a name="chap00" id="chap00"></a><i>INTRODUCTION.</i></h2>


<p>Though some of the essays in this volume have
appeared in various serials, the majority of them were
written expressly for their present purpose, and they
are now arranged in a designed order. During some
years of study of Greek, Indian, and savage mythologies,
I have become more and more impressed
with a sense of the inadequacy of the prevalent
method of comparative mythology. That method is
based on the belief that myths are the result of a
disease of language, as the pearl is the result of a
disease of the oyster. It is argued that men at some
period, or periods, spoke in a singular style of coloured
and concrete language, and that their children retained
the phrases of this language after losing hold
of the original meaning. The consequence was the
growth of myths about supposed persons, whose
names had originally been mere &lsquo;appellations.&rsquo; In
conformity with this hypothesis the method of comparative
mythology examines the proper names which
occur in myths. The notion is that these names contain
a key to the meaning of the story, and that, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
fact, of the story the names are the germs and the
oldest surviving part.</p>

<p>The objections to this method are so numerous
that it is difficult to state them briefly. The attempt,
however, must be made. To desert the path opened
by the most eminent scholars is in itself presumptuous;
the least that an innovator can do is to
give his reasons for advancing in a novel direction.
If this were a question of scholarship merely, it
would be simply foolhardy to differ from men like
Max M&uuml;ller, Adalbert Kuhn, Br&eacute;al, and many
others. But a revolutionary mythologist is encouraged
by finding that these scholars frequently
differ from each other. Examples will be found chiefly
in the essays styled &lsquo;<a href="#chap03">The Myth of Cronus</a>,&rsquo; &lsquo;<a href="#chap05">A Far-Travelled
Tale</a>,&rsquo; and &lsquo;<a href="#chap04">Cupid and Psyche</a>.&rsquo; Why, then,
do distinguished scholars and mythologists reach
such different goals? Clearly because their method
is so precarious. They all analyse the names in
myths;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but, where one scholar decides that the name
is originally Sanskrit, another holds that it is purely
Greek, and a third, perhaps, is all for an Accadian
etymology, or a Semitic derivation. Again, even
when scholars agree as to the original root from
which a name springs, they differ as much as ever as
to the meaning of the name in its present place. The
inference is that the analysis of names, on which the
whole edifice of philological &lsquo;comparative mythology&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
rests, is a foundation of shifting sand. The method
is called &lsquo;orthodox,&rsquo; but, among those who practise
it, there is none of the beautiful unanimity of orthodoxy.</p>

<p>These objections are not made by the unscholarly
anthropologist alone. Curtius has especially remarked
the difficulties which beset the &lsquo;etymological operations&rsquo;
in the case of proper names. &lsquo;Peculiarly
dubious and perilous is mythological etymology. Are
we to look for the sources of the divine names in aspects
of nature, or in moral conceptions; in special
Greek geographical conditions, or in natural circumstances
which are everywhere the same: in dawn with
her rays, or in clouds with their floods; are we to seek
the origin of the names of heroes in things historical
and human, or in physical phenomena?&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Professor
Tiele, of Leyden, says much the same thing: &lsquo;The uncertainties
are great, and there is a constant risk of
taking mere <i>jeux d&rsquo;esprit</i> for scientific results.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Every
name has, if we can discover or conjecture it, a meaning.
That meaning&mdash;be it &lsquo;large&rsquo; or &lsquo;small,&rsquo; &lsquo;loud&rsquo;
or &lsquo;bright,&rsquo; &lsquo;wise&rsquo; or &lsquo;dark,&rsquo; &lsquo;swift&rsquo; or &lsquo;slow&rsquo;&mdash;is
always capable of being explained as an epithet of
the sun, or the cloud, or of both. Whatever, then,
a name may signify, some scholars will find that it
originally denoted the cloud, if they belong to one
school, or the sun or dawn, if they belong to another
faction. Obviously this process is a mere <i>jeu d&rsquo;esprit</i>.
This logic would be admitted in no other science,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
and, by similar arguments, any name whatever might
be shown to be appropriate to a solar hero.</p>

<p>The scholarly method has now been applied for
many years, and what are the results? The ideas
attained by the method have been so popularised that
they are actually made to enter into the education of
children, and are published in primers and catechisms
of mythology. But what has a discreet scholar to
say to the whole business? &lsquo;The difficult task of
interpreting mythical names has, so far, produced few
certain results&rsquo;&mdash;so writes Otto Schrader.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Though
Schrader still has hopes of better things, it is admitted
that the present results are highly disputable. In
England, where one set of these results has become
an article of faith, readers chiefly accept the opinions
of a single etymological school, and thus escape the
difficulty of making up their minds when scholars
differ. But differ scholars do, so widely and so often,
that scarcely any solid advantages have been gained
in mythology from the philological method.</p>

<p>The method of philological mythology is thus
discredited by the disputes of its adherents. The
system may be called orthodox, but it is an orthodoxy
which alters with every new scholar who enters
the sacred enclosure. Even were there more harmony,
the analysis of names could throw little light
on myths. In stories the names may well be, and
often demonstrably are, the latest, not the original,
feature. Tales, at first told of &lsquo;Somebody,&rsquo; get new
names attached to them, and obtain a new local
habitation, wherever they wander. &lsquo;One of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
leading personages to be met in the traditions of the
world is really no more than&mdash;Somebody. There is
nothing this wondrous creature cannot achieve; one
only restriction binds him at all&mdash;that the name he
assumes shall have some sort of congruity with the
office he undertakes, <em>and even from this he oftentimes
breaks loose</em>.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> We may be pretty sure that the adventures
of Jason, Perseus, &OElig;dipous, were originally
told only of &lsquo;Somebody.&rsquo; The names are later additions,
and vary in various lands. A glance at the
essay on &lsquo;<a href="#chap04">Cupid and Psyche</a>&rsquo; will show that a history
like theirs is known, where neither they nor their
counterparts in the Veda, Urvasi and Pururavas were
ever heard of; while the incidents of the Jason legend
are familiar where no Greek word was ever spoken.
Finally, the names in common use among savages
are usually derived from natural phenomena, often
from clouds, sky, sun, dawn. If, then, a name in a
myth can be proved to mean cloud, sky, sun, or what
not (and usually one set of scholars find clouds
where others see the dawn), we must not instantly
infer that the myth is a nature-myth. Though,
doubtless, the heroes in it were never real people,
the names are as much common names of real people
in the savage state, as Smith and Brown are names
of civilised men.</p>

<p>For all these reasons, but chiefly because of the
fact that stories are usually anonymous at first, that
names are added later, and that stories naturally
crystallise round any famous name, heroic, divine, or
human, the process of analysis of names is most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
precarious and untrustworthy. A story is told of Zeus:
Zeus means sky, and the story is interpreted by
scholars as a sky myth. The modern interpreter
forgets, first, that to the myth-maker sky did not at
all mean the same thing as it means to him. Sky
meant, not an airy, infinite, radiant vault, but a person,
and, most likely, a savage person. Secondly, the
interpreter forgets that the tale (say the tale of Zeus,
Demeter, and the mutilated Ram) may have been
originally anonymous, and only later attributed to
Zeus, as unclaimed jests are attributed to Sheridan or
Talleyrand. Consequently no heavenly phenomena
will be the basis and explanation of the story. If
one thing in mythology be certain, it is that myths
are always changing masters, that the old tales are
always being told with new names. Where, for example,
is the value of a philological analysis of the
name of Jason? As will be seen in the essay &lsquo;<a href="#chap05">A Far-Travelled
Tale</a>,&rsquo; the analysis of the name of Jason is
fanciful, precarious, disputed, while the essence of his
myth is current in Samoa, Finland, North America,
Madagascar, and other lands, where the name was
never heard, and where the characters in the story
have other names or are anonymous.</p>

<p>For these reasons, and others too many to be adduced
here, I have ventured to differ from the current
opinion that myths must be interpreted chiefly by
philological analysis of names. The system adopted
here is explained in the first essay, called &lsquo;<a href="#chap01">The
Method of Folklore</a>.&rsquo; The name, Folklore, is not
a good one, but &lsquo;comparative mythology&rsquo; is usually
claimed exclusively by the philological interpreters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
The second essay, &lsquo;<a href="#chap02">The Bull-Roarer</a>,&rsquo; is intended
to show that certain peculiarities in the Greek mysteries
occur also in the mysteries of savages, and that
on Greek soil they are survivals of savagery.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<a href="#chap03">The Myth of Cronus</a>&rsquo; tries to prove that the first
part of the legend is a savage nature-myth, surviving
in Greek religion, while the sequel is a set of ideas
common to savages.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<a href="#chap04">Cupid and Psyche</a>&rsquo; traces another Aryan myth
among savage races, and attempts to show that the
central incident of the tale may have had its origin
in a rule of barbarous etiquette.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<a href="#chap05">A Far-Travelled Tale</a>&rsquo; examines a part of the Jason
myth. This myth appears neither to be an explanation
of natural phenomena (like part of &lsquo;<a href="#chap03">The Myth
of Cronus</a>&rsquo;), nor based on a widespread custom (like

the story may have been diffused by slow filtration
from race to race all over the globe, as there seems
no reason why it should have been invented separately
(as a myth explanatory of natural phenomena or of
customs might be) in many different places.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<a href="#chap06">Apollo and the Mouse</a>&rsquo; suggests hypothetically,
as a possible explanation of the tie between the God
and the Beast, that Apollo-worship superseded, but
did not eradicate, Totemism. The suggestion is little
more than a conjecture.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<a href="#chap07">Star Myths</a>&rsquo; points out that Greek myths of stars
are a survival from the savage stage of fancy in which
such stories are natural.</p>

<h2><a name="chap01" id="chap01"></a><i>THE METHOD OF FOLKLORE.</i></h2>


<p>After the heavy rain of a thunderstorm has washed
the soil, it sometimes happens that a child, or a rustic,
finds a wedge-shaped piece of metal or a few triangular
flints in a field or near a road. There was
no such piece of metal, there were no such flints, lying
there yesterday, and the finder is puzzled about the
origin of the objects on which he has lighted. He
carries them home, and the village wisdom determines
that the wedge-shaped piece of metal is a &lsquo;thunder-bolt,&rsquo;
or that the bits of flint are &lsquo;elf-shots,&rsquo; the heads
of fairy arrows. Such things are still treasured in
remote nooks of England, and the &lsquo;thunder-bolt&rsquo; is
applied to cure certain maladies by its touch.</p>

<p>As for the fairy arrows, we know that even in
ancient Etruria they were looked on as magical, for
we sometimes see their points set, as amulets, in the
gold of Etruscan necklaces. In Perugia the arrow-heads
are still sold as charms. All educated people,
of course, have long been aware that the metal wedge
is a celt, or ancient bronze axe-head, and that it was
not fairies, but the forgotten peoples of this island,
who used the arrows with the tips of flint. Thunder is
only so far connected with them that the heavy rains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
loosen the surface soil, and lay bare its long-hidden
secrets.</p>

<p>There is a science, Arch&aelig;ology, which collects and
compares the material relics of old races, the axes and
arrow-heads. There is a form of study, Folklore, which
collects and compares the similar but immaterial relics
of old races, the surviving superstitions and stories,
the ideas which are in our time but not of it. Properly
speaking, folklore is only concerned with the
legends, customs, beliefs, of the Folk, of the people, of
the classes which have least been altered by education,
which have shared least in progress. But the student
of folklore soon finds that these unprogressive
classes retain many of the beliefs and ways of savages,
just as the Hebridean people used spindle-whorls of
stone, and bake clay pots without the aid of the
wheel, like modern South Sea Islanders, or like their
own prehistoric ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The student of folklore is
thus led to examine the usages, myths, and ideas of
savages, which are still retained, in rude enough shape,
by the European peasantry. Lastly, he observes that
a few similar customs and ideas survive in the most
conservative elements of the life of educated peoples,
in ritual, ceremonial, and religious traditions and
myths. Though such remains are rare in England,
we may note the custom of leading the dead soldier&rsquo;s
horse behind his master to the grave, a relic of days
when the horse would have been sacrificed.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> We may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
observe the persistence of the ceremony by which the
monarch, at his coronation, takes his seat on the sacred
stone of Scone, probably an ancient fetich stone. Not
to speak, here, of our own religious traditions, the old
vein of savage rite and belief is found very near the
surface of ancient Greek religion. It wants but some
stress of circumstance, something answering to the
storm shower that reveals the flint arrow-heads, to
bring savage ritual to the surface of classical religion.
In sore need, a human victim was only too likely to
be demanded; while a feast-day, or a mystery, set the
Greeks dancing serpent-dances or bear-dances like
Red Indians, or swimming with sacred pigs, or leaping
about in imitation of wolves, or holding a dog-feast,
and offering dog&rsquo;s flesh to the gods.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Thus the student
of folklore soon finds that he must enlarge his field,
and examine, not only popular European story and
practice, but savage ways and ideas, and the myths
and usages of the educated classes in civilised races.
In this extended sense the term &lsquo;folklore&rsquo; will frequently
be used in the following essays. The idea
of the writer is that mythology cannot fruitfully be
studied apart from folklore, while some knowledge
of anthropology is required in both sciences.</p>

<p>The science of Folklore, if we may call it a science,
finds everywhere, close to the surface of civilised life,
the remains of ideas as old as the stone elf-shots, older
than the celt of bronze. In proverbs and riddles, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
nursery tales and superstitions, we detect the relics
of a stage of thought, which is dying out in Europe,
but which still exists in many parts of the world.
Now, just as the flint arrow-heads are scattered everywhere,
in all the continents and isles, and everywhere
are much alike, and bear no very definite marks of
the special influence of race, so it is with the habits
and legends investigated by the student of folklore.
The stone arrow-head buried in a Scottish cairn is
like those which were interred with Algonquin chiefs.
The flints found in Egyptian soil, or beside the
tumulus on the plain of Marathon, nearly resemble
the stones which tip the reed arrow of the modern
Samoyed. Perhaps only a skilled experience could
discern, in a heap of such arrow-heads, the specimens
which are found in America or Africa from those
which are unearthed in Europe. Even in the products
of more advanced industry, we see early pottery,
for example, so closely alike everywhere that, in the
British Museum, Mexican vases have, ere now, been
mixed up on the same shelf with archaic vessels from
Greece. In the same way, if a superstition or a riddle
were offered to a student of folklore, he would have
much difficulty in guessing its <em>provenance</em>, and naming
the race from which it was brought. Suppose you
tell a folklorist that, in a certain country, when any one
sneezes, people say &lsquo;Good luck to you,&rsquo; the student
cannot say <i>&agrave; priori</i> what country you refer to, what
race you have in your thoughts. It may be Florida,
as Florida was when first discovered; it may be Zululand,
or West Africa, or ancient Rome, or Homeric
Greece, or Palestine. In all these, and many other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
regions, the sneeze was welcomed as an auspicious
omen. The little superstition is as widely distributed
as the flint arrow-heads. Just as the object and use
of the arrow-heads became intelligible when we found
similar weapons in actual use among savages, so the
salutation to the sneezer becomes intelligible when
we learn that the savage has a good reason for it.
He thinks the sneeze expels an evil spirit. Proverbs,
again, and riddles are as universally scattered, and
the Wolufs puzzle over the same <i>devinettes</i> as the
Scotch schoolboy or the Breton peasant. Thus, for
instance, the Wolufs of Senegal ask each other, &lsquo;What
flies for ever, and rests never?&rsquo;&mdash;Answer, &lsquo;The Wind.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Who are the comrades that always fight, and never
hurt each other?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;The Teeth.&rsquo; In France, as we
read in the &lsquo;Recueil de Calembours,&rsquo; the people ask,
&lsquo;What runs faster than a horse, crosses water, and is
not wet?&rsquo;&mdash;Answer, &lsquo;The Sun.&rsquo; The Samoans put
the riddle, &lsquo;A man who stands between two ravenous
fishes?&rsquo;&mdash;Answer, &lsquo;The tongue between the teeth.&rsquo;
Again, &lsquo;There are twenty brothers, each with a hat on
his head?&rsquo;&mdash;Answer, &lsquo;Fingers and toes, with nails for
hats.&rsquo; This is like the French &lsquo;<i>un p&egrave;re a douze fils?</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;<i>l&rsquo;an</i>.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
A comparison of M. Rolland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Devinettes&rsquo;
with the Woluf conundrums of Boilat, the Samoan
examples in Turner&rsquo;s &lsquo;Samoa,&rsquo; and the Scotch enigmas
collected by Chambers, will show the identity of
peasant and savage humour.</p>

<p>A few examples, less generally known, may be
given to prove that the beliefs of folklore are not
peculiar to any one race or stock of men. The first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
case is remarkable: it occurs in Mexico and Ceylon,
and has been found in other regions. In <i>Macmillan&rsquo;s
Magazine</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> is published a paper by Mrs. Edwards,
called &lsquo;The Mystery of the Pezazi.&rsquo; The events
described in this narrative occurred on August
28, 1876, in a bungalow some thirty miles from
Badiella. The narrator occupied a new house on
an estate called Allagalla. Her native servants
soon asserted that the place was haunted by a
Pezazi. The English visitors saw and heard nothing
extraordinary till a certain night: an abridged
account of what happened then may be given in the
words of Mrs. Edwards:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Wrapped in dreams, I lay on the night in question
tranquilly sleeping, but gradually roused to a perception that
discordant sounds disturbed the serenity of my slumber.
Loth to stir, I still dosed on, the sounds, however, becoming,
as it seemed, more determined to make themselves heard!
and I awoke to the consciousness that they proceeded
from a belt of adjacent jungle, and resembled the noise that
would be produced by some person felling timber.</p>

<p>Shutting my ears to the disturbance, I made no sign,
until, with an expression of impatience, E&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;suddenly
started up, when I laid a detaining grasp upon his arm,
murmuring that there was no need to think of rising at
present&mdash;it must be quite early, and the kitchen cooly was
doubtless cutting firewood in good time. E&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;responded,
in a tone of slight contempt, that no one could be cutting
firewood at that hour, and the sounds were more suggestive
of felling jungle; and he then inquired how long I had
been listening to them. Now thoroughly aroused I replied
that I had heard the sounds for some time, at first confusing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
them with my dreams, but soon sufficiently awakening to
the fact that they were no mere phantoms of my imagination,
but a reality. During our conversation the noises
became more distinct and loud; blow after blow resounded,
as of the axe descending upon the tree, followed by the
crash of the falling timber. Renewed blows announced
the repetition of the operations on another tree, and continued
till several were devastated.</p>
</div>

<p>It is unnecessary to tell more of the tale. In
spite of minute examinations and close search, no
solution of the mystery of the noises, on this or
any other occasion, was ever found. The natives, of
course, attributed the disturbance to the <i>Pezazi</i> or
goblin. No one perhaps has asserted that the Aztecs
were connected by ties of race with the people of
Ceylon. Yet when the Spaniards conquered Mexico,
and when Sahagun (one of the earliest missionaries)
collected the legends of the people, he found them,
like the Cingalese, strong believers in the mystic
tree-felling. We translate Sahagun&rsquo;s account of the
&lsquo;midnight axe&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>When so any man heareth the sound of strokes in the
night as if one were felling trees, he reckons it an evil
boding. And this sound they call <i>youaltepuztli</i> (<i>youalli</i>,
night; and <i>tepuztli</i>, copper), which signifies &lsquo;the midnight
hatchet.&rsquo; This noise cometh about the time of the first
sleep, when all men slumber soundly, and the night is still.
The sound of strokes smitten was first noted by the temple-servants,
called <i>tlamacazque</i>, at the hour when they go in
the night to make their offering of reeds or of boughs of
pine, for so was their custom, and this penance they did on
the neighbouring hills, and that when the night was far spent.
Whenever they heard such a sound as one makes when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
splits wood with an axe (a noise that may be heard afar
off), they drew thence an omen of evil, and were afraid
and said that the sounds were part of the witchery of
Tezcatlipoca, that often thus dismayeth men who journey in
the night. Now, when tidings of these things came to a
certain brave man, one exercised in war, he drew near, being
guided by the sound, till he came to the very cause of the
hubbub. And when he came upon it, with difficulty he
caught it, for the thing was hard to catch; natheless at last
he overtook that which ran before him; and behold, it was
a man without a heart, and, on either side of the chest, two
holes that opened and shut, and so made the noise. Then the
man put his hand within the breast of the figure and grasped
the breast and shook it hard, demanding some grace or gift.</p>
</div>

<p>As a rule, the grace demanded was power to make
captives in war. The curious coincidence of the
&lsquo;midnight axe,&rsquo; occurring in lands so remote as
Ceylon and Mexico, and the singular attestation by
an English lady of the actual existence of the disturbance,
makes this <i>youaltepuztli</i> one of the quaintest
things in the province of the folklorist. But, whatever
the cause of the noise, or of the beliefs connected
with the noise, may be, no one would explain them as
the result of community of <em>race</em> between Cingalese
and Aztecs. Nor would this explanation be offered
to account for the Aztec and English belief that the
creaking of furniture is an omen of death in a house.
Obviously, these opinions are the expression of a
common state of superstitious fancy, not the signs of
an original community of origin.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
Let us take another piece of folklore. All
North-country English folk know the <i>Kernababy</i>.
The custom of the &lsquo;Kernababy&rsquo; is commonly observed
in England, or, at all events, in Scotland,
where the writer has seen many a kernababy. The
last gleanings of the last field are bound up in a
rude imitation of the human shape, and dressed
in some tag-rags of finery. The usage has fallen
into the conservative hands of children, but of old
&lsquo;the Maiden&rsquo; was a regular image of the harvest
goddess, which, with a sickle and sheaves in her
arms, attended by a crowd of reapers, and accompanied
with music, followed the last carts home to
the farm.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It is odd enough that &lsquo;the Maiden&rsquo; should
exactly translate <ins class="greek" title="Kor&ecirc;">&#922;&#8057;&#961;&#951;</ins>, the old Sicilian name of the
daughter of Demeter. &lsquo;The Maiden&rsquo; has dwindled,
then, among us to the rudimentary kernababy; but
ancient Peru had her own Maiden, her Harvest
Goddess. Here it is easy to trace the natural idea at
the basis of the superstitious practice which links the
shores of the Pacific with our own northern coast.
Just as a portion of the yule-log and of the Christmas
bread were kept all the year through, a kind of
nest-egg of plenteous food and fire, so the kernababy,
English or Peruvian, is an earnest that corn
will not fail all through the year, till next harvest
comes. For this reason the kernababy used to be
treasured from autumn&rsquo;s end to autumn&rsquo;s end, though
now it commonly disappears very soon after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
harvest home. It is thus that Acosta describes in
Grimston&rsquo;s old translation (1604) the Peruvian kernababy
and the Peruvian harvest home:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>This feast is made comming from the chacra or farme unto
the house, saying certaine songs, and praying that the Mays
(maize) may long continue, the which they call <i>Mama cora</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>What a chance this word offers to etymologists
of the old school: how promptly they would recognise,
in <i>mama</i> mother&mdash;<ins class="greek" title="m&ecirc;t&ecirc;r">&#956;&#8053;&#964;&#951;&#961;</ins>, and in <i>cora</i>&mdash;<ins class="greek" title="kor&ecirc;">&#954;&#8057;&#961;&#951;</ins>, the
Mother and the Maiden, the feast of Demeter and
Persephone! However, the days of that old school
of antiquarianism are numbered. To return to the
Peruvian harvest home:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>They take a certaine portion of the most fruitefull of the
Mays that growes in their farmes, the which they put in a
certaine granary which they do calle Pirua, with certaine
ceremonies, watching three nightes; they put this Mays in
the richest garments they have, and, being thus wrapped and
dressed, they worship this Pirua, and hold it in great veneration,
saying it is the Mother of the Mays of their inheritances,
and that by this means the Mays augments and is preserved.
In this moneth they make a particular sacrifice, and the
witches demand of this Pirua, &lsquo;if it hath strength sufficient
to continue until the next yeare,&rsquo; and if it answers &lsquo;no,&rsquo; then
they carry this Mays to the farme to burne, whence they
brought it, according to every man&rsquo;s power, then they make
another Pirua, with the same ceremonies, saying that they
renue it, to the ende that the seede of the Mays may not perish.</p>
</div>

<p>The idea that the maize can speak need not surprise
us; the Mexican held much the same belief, according
to Sahagun:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It was thought that if some grains of maize fell on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
ground he who saw them lying there was bound to lift them,
wherein, if he failed, he harmed the maize, which plained
itself of him to God, saying, &lsquo;Lord, punish this man, who
saw me fallen and raised me not again; punish him with
famine, that he may learn not to hold me in dishonour.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Well, in all this affair of the Scotch kernababy,
and the Peruvian <i>Mama cora</i>, we need no explanation
beyond the common simple ideas of human nature.
We are not obliged to hold, either that the Peruvians
and Scotch are akin by blood, nor that, at some forgotten
time, they met each other, and borrowed each
other&rsquo;s superstitions.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Again, when we find Odysseus
sacrificing a black sheep to the dead,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and when we
read that the Ovahereroes in South Africa also
appease with a black sheep the spirits of the departed,
we do not feel it necessary to hint that the
Ovahereroes are of Greek descent, or have borrowed
their ritual from the Greeks. The connection between
the colour black, and mourning for the dead,
is natural and almost universal.</p>

<p>Examples like these might be adduced in any
number. We might show how, in magic, negroes of
Barbadoes make clay effigies of their enemies, and
pierce them, just as Greeks did in Plato&rsquo;s time, or the
men of Accad in remotest antiquity. We might remark
the Australian black putting sharp bits of quartz
in the tracks of an enemy who has gone by, that the
enemy may be lamed; and we might point to Boris
Godunof forbidding the same practice among the
Russians. We might watch Scotch, and Australians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
and Jews, and French, and Aztecs spreading dust
round the body of a dead man, that the footprints of
his ghost, or of other ghosts, may be detected next
morning. We might point to a similar device in a
modern novel, where the presence of a ghost is suspected,
as proof of the similar workings of the
Australian mind and of the mind of Mrs. Riddell.
We shall later turn to ancient Greece, and show how
the serpent-dances, the habit of smearing the body
with clay, and other odd rites of the mysteries, were
common to Hellenic religion, and to the religion of
African, Australian, and American tribes.</p>

<p>Now, with regard to all these strange usages,
what is the method of folklore? The method is,
when an apparently irrational and anomalous custom
is found in any country, to look for a country where
a similar practice is found, and where the practice is
no longer irrational and anomalous, but in harmony
with the manners and ideas of the people among
whom it prevails. That Greeks should dance about
in their mysteries with harmless serpents in their
hands looks quite unintelligible. When a wild tribe
of Red Indians does the same thing, as a trial of
courage, with real rattlesnakes, we understand the
Red Man&rsquo;s motives, and may conjecture that similar
motives once existed among the ancestors of the
Greeks. Our method, then, is to compare the seemingly
meaningless customs or manners of civilised
races with the similar customs and manners which
exist among the uncivilised and still retain their
meaning. It is not necessary for comparison of this
sort that the uncivilised and the civilised race should
be of the same stock, nor need we prove that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
were ever in contact with each other. Similar conditions
of mind produce similar practices, apart from
identity of race, or borrowing of ideas and manners.</p>

<p>Let us return to the example of the flint arrow-heads.
Everywhere neolithic arrow-heads are pretty
much alike. The cause of the resemblance is no more
than this, that men, with the same needs, the same
materials, and the same rude instruments, everywhere
produced the same kind of arrow-head. No hypothesis
of interchange of ideas nor of community of
race is needed to explain the resemblance of form in
the missiles. Very early pottery in any region is, for
the same causes, like very early pottery in any other
region. The same sort of similarity was explained by
the same resemblances in human nature, when we
touched on the identity of magical practices and of
superstitious beliefs. This method is fairly well established
and orthodox when we deal with usages
and superstitious beliefs; but may we apply the same
method when we deal with myths?</p>

<p>Here a difficulty occurs. Mythologists, as a rule, are
averse to the method of folklore. They think it scientific
to compare only the myths of races which speak languages
of the same family, and of races which have,
in historic times, been actually in proved contact with
each other. Thus, most mythologists hold it correct
to compare Greek, Slavonic, Celtic, and Indian stories,
because Greeks, Slavs, Celts, and Hindoos all speak
languages of the same family. Again, they hold it
correct to compare Chald&aelig;an and Greek myths, because
the Greeks and the Chald&aelig;ans were brought
into contact through the Ph&oelig;nicians, and by other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
intermediaries, such as the Hittites. But the same
mythologists will vow that it is unscientific to compare
a Maori or a Hottentot or an Eskimo myth with
an Aryan story, because Maoris and Eskimo and
Hottentots do not speak languages akin to that of
Greece, nor can we show that the ancestors of
Greeks, Maoris, Hottentots, and Eskimo were ever
in contact with each other in historical times.</p>

<p>Now the peculiarity of the method of folklore is
that it will venture to compare (with due caution and
due examination of evidence) the myths of the most
widely severed races. Holding that myth is a product
of the early human fancy, working on the most
rudimentary knowledge of the outer world, the student
of folklore thinks that differences of race do not
much affect the early mythop&oelig;ic faculty. He will
not be surprised if Greeks and Australian blacks are
in the same tale.</p>

<p>In each case, he holds, all the circumstances of
the case must be examined and considered. For
instance, when the Australians tell a myth about the
Pleiades very like the Greek myth of the Pleiades,
we must ask a number of questions. Is the Australian
version authentic? Can the people who told it
have heard it from a European? If these questions
are answered so as to make it apparent that the
Australian Pleiad myth is of genuine native origin,
we need not fly to the conclusion that the Australians
are a lost and forlorn branch of the Aryan race.
Two other hypotheses present themselves. First,
the human species is of unknown antiquity. In the
moderate allowance of 250,000 years, there is time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
for stories to have wandered all round the world, as
the Aggry beads of Ashanti have probably crossed
the continent from Egypt, as the Asiatic jade (if
Asiatic it be) has arrived in Swiss lake-dwellings, as
an African trade-cowry is said to have been found
in a Cornish barrow, as an Indian Ocean shell has
been discovered in a prehistoric bone-cave in Poland.
This slow filtration of tales is not absolutely out of the
question. Two causes would especially help to transmit
myths. The first is slavery and slave-stealing,
the second is the habit of capturing brides from alien
stocks, and the law which forbids marriage with a woman
of a man&rsquo;s own family. Slaves and captured brides
would bring their native legends among alien peoples.</p>

<p>But there is another possible way of explaining
the resemblance (granting that it is proved) of the
Greek and Australian Pleiad myth. The object of
both myths is to account for the grouping and other
phenomena of the constellations. May not similar
explanatory stories have occurred to the ancestors of
the Australians, and to the ancestors of the Greeks,
however remote their home, while they were still in
the savage condition? The best way to investigate
this point is to collect all known savage and civilised
stellar myths, and see what points they have in
common. If they all agree in character, though the
Greek tales are full of grace, while those of the
Australians or Brazilians are rude enough, we may
plausibly account for the similarity of myths, as we
accounted for the similarity of flint arrow-heads.
The myths, like the arrow-heads, resemble each other
because they were originally framed to meet the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
needs out of the same material. In the case of the
arrow-heads, the need was for something hard, heavy,
and sharp&mdash;the material was flint. In the case of the
myths, the need was to explain certain phenomena&mdash;the
material (so to speak) was an early state of the
human mind, to which all objects seemed equally
endowed with human personality, and to which no
metamorphosis appeared impossible.</p>

<p>In the following essays, then, the myths and
customs of various peoples will be compared, even
when these peoples talk languages of alien families,
and have never (so far as history shows us) been in
actual contact. Our method throughout will be to
place the usage, or myth, which is unintelligible when
found among a civilised race, beside the similar myth
which is intelligible enough when it is found among
savages. A mean term will be found in the folklore
preserved by the non-progressive classes in a progressive
people. This folklore represents, in the midst of a
civilised race, the savage ideas out of which civilisation
has been evolved. The conclusion will usually be that
the fact which puzzles us by its presence in civilisation
is a relic surviving from the time when the ancestors
of a civilised race were in the state of savagery. By
this method it is not necessary that &lsquo;some sort of
genealogy should be established&rsquo; between the Australian
and the Greek narrators of a similar myth, nor
between the Greek and Australian possessors of a
similar usage. The hypothesis will be that the myth,
or usage, is common to both races, not because of
original community of stock, not because of contact
and borrowing, but because the ancestors of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
Greeks passed through the savage intellectual condition
in which we find the Australians.</p>

<p>The questions may be asked, Has race nothing,
then, to do with myth? Do peoples never consciously
borrow myths from each other? The answer is, that
race has a great deal to do with the development
of myth, if it be race which confers on a people its
national genius, and its capacity of becoming civilised.
If race does this, then race affects, in the most powerful
manner, the ultimate development of myth. No one is
likely to confound a Homeric myth with a myth from
the Edda, nor either with a myth from a Brahmana,
though in all three cases the substance, the original
set of ideas, may be much the same. In all three you
have anthropomorphic gods, capable of assuming animal
shapes, tricky, capricious, limited in many undivine
ways, yet endowed with magical powers. So far the
mythical gods of Homer, of the Edda, of any of
the Brahmanas, are on a level with each other, and
not much above the gods of savage mythology. This
stuff of myth is <i>quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab
omnibus</i>, and is the original gift of the savage intellect.
But the final treatment, the ultimate literary form of
the myth, varies in each race. Homeric gods, like Red
Indian, Thlinkeet, or Australian gods, can assume the
shapes of birds. But when we read, in Homer, of the
arming of Athene, the hunting of Artemis, the vision
of golden Aphrodite, the apparition of Hermes, like a
young man when the flower of youth is loveliest, then
we recognise the effect of race upon myth, the effect of
the Greek genius at work on rude material. Between
the Olympians and a Thlinkeet god there is all the
difference that exists between the Demeter of Cnidos
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
and an image from Easter Island. Again, the Scandinavian
gods, when their tricks are laid aside, when
Odin is neither assuming the shape of worm nor of
raven, have a martial dignity, a noble enduring spirit
of their own. Race comes out in that, as it does in the
endless sacrifices, soma drinking, magical austerities,
and puerile follies of Vedic and Brahmanic gods, the
deities of a people fallen early into its sacerdotage and
priestly second childhood. Thus race declares itself in
the ultimate literary form and character of mythology,
while the common savage basis and stuff of myths may
be clearly discerned in the horned, and cannibal, and
shape-shifting, and adulterous gods of Greece, of India,
of the North. They all show their common savage
origin, when the poet neglects Freya&rsquo;s command and
tells of what the gods did &lsquo;in the morning of Time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As to borrowing, we have already shown that in
prehistoric times there must have been much transmission
of myth. The migrations of peoples, the
traffic in slaves, the law of exogamy, which always
keeps bringing alien women into the families&mdash;all
these things favoured the migration of myth. But the
process lies behind history: we can only guess at it, we
can seldom trace a popular legend on its travels. In the
case of the cultivated ancient peoples, we know that
they themselves believed they had borrowed their religions
from each other. When the Greeks first found
the Egyptians practising mysteries like their own,
they leaped to the conclusion that their own rites had
been imported from Egypt. We, who know that both
Greek and Egyptian rites had many points in common
with those of Mandans, Zunis, Bushmen, Australians&mdash;people
quite unconnected with Egypt&mdash;feel less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
confident about the hypothesis of borrowing. We
may, indeed, regard Adonis, and Zeus Bag&aelig;us, and
Melicertes, as importations from Ph&oelig;nicia. In later
times, too, the Greeks, and still more the Romans,
extended a free hospitality to alien gods and legends,
to Serapis, Isis, the wilder Dionysiac revels, and so
forth. But this habit of borrowing was regarded with
disfavour by pious conservatives, and was probably,
in the width of its hospitality at least, an innovation.
As Tiele remarks, we cannot derive Dionysus from
the Assyrian <i>Daian nisi</i> &lsquo;judge of men,&rsquo; a name of
the solar god Samas, without ascertaining that the
wine-god exercised judicial functions, and was a god
of the sun. These derivations, &lsquo;shocking to common-sense,&rsquo;
are to be distrusted as part of the intoxication
of new learning. Some Assyrian scholars actually
derive <i>Hades</i> from <i>Bit Edi</i> or <i>Bit Hadi</i>&mdash;&lsquo;though
unluckily,&rsquo; says Tiele, &lsquo;there is no such word in the
Assyrian text.&rsquo; On the whole topic Tiele&rsquo;s essay<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
deserves to be consulted. Granting, then, that elements
in the worship of Dionysus, Aphrodite, and
other gods, may have been imported with the strange
&AElig;gypto-Assyrian vases and jewels of the Sidonians,
we still find the same basis of rude savage ideas. We
may push back a god from Greece to Ph&oelig;nicia, from
Ph&oelig;nicia to Accadia, but, at the end of the end, we
reach a legend full of myths like those which Bushmen
tell by the camp fire, Eskimo in their dark huts,
and Australians in the shade of the <i>gunyeh</i>&mdash;myths
cruel, puerile, obscene, like the fancies of the savage
myth-makers from which they sprang.</p>

<h2><a name="chap02" id="chap02"></a><i>THE BULL-ROARER.</i><br />
<br />
<small>A STUDY OF THE MYSTERIES.</small></h2>


<p>As the belated traveller makes his way through the
monotonous plains of Australia, through the Bush,
with its level expanses and clumps of grey-blue gum
trees, he occasionally hears a singular sound. Beginning
low, with a kind of sharp tone thrilling through
a whirring noise, it grows louder and louder, till it
becomes a sort of fluttering windy roar. If the
traveller be a new-comer, he is probably puzzled to
the last degree. If he be an Englishman, country-bred,
he says to himself, &lsquo;Why, that is the bull-roarer.&rsquo;
If he knows the colony and the ways of the natives,
he knows that the blacks are celebrating their tribal
mysteries. The roaring noise is made to warn all
women to keep out of the way. Just as Pentheus
was killed (with the approval of Theocritus) because
he profaned the rites of the women-worshippers of
Dionysus, so, among the Australian blacks, men must,
at their peril, keep out of the way of female, and
women out of the way of male, celebrations.</p>

<p>The instrument which produces the sounds that
warn women to remain afar is a toy familiar to
English country lads. They call it the bull-roarer.
The common bull-roarer is an inexpensive toy which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
any one can make. I do not, however, recommend
it to families, for two reasons. In the first place,
it produces a most horrible and unexampled din,
which endears it to the very young, but renders it
detested by persons of mature age. In the second
place, the character of the toy is such that it will
almost infallibly break all that is fragile in the house
where it is used, and will probably put out the eyes
of some of the inhabitants. Having thus, I trust,
said enough to prevent all good boys from inflicting
bull-roarers on their parents, pastors and masters, I
proceed (in the interests of science) to show how the
toy is made. Nothing can be less elaborate. You
take a piece of the commonest wooden board, say
the lid of a packing-case, about a sixth of an inch
in thickness, and about eight inches long and three
broad, and you sharpen the ends. When finished,
the toy may be about the shape of a large bay-leaf,
or a &lsquo;fish&rsquo; used as a counter (that is how the New
Zealanders make it), or the sides may be left plain in
the centre, and only sharpened towards the extremities,
as in an Australian example lent me by Mr. Tylor.
Then tie a strong piece of string, about thirty inches
long, to one end of the piece of wood, and the bull-roarer
(the Australian natives call it <i>turndun</i>, and the
Greeks call it <ins class="greek" title="rhombos">&#8165;&#8057;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#962;</ins>) is complete. Now twist the
end of the string tightly about your finger, and whirl
the bull-roarer rapidly round and round. For a few
moments nothing will happen. In a very interesting
lecture delivered at the Royal Institution, Mr. Taylor
once exhibited a bull-roarer. At first it did nothing
particular when it was whirled round, and the audience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
began to fear that the experiment was like those
chemical ones often exhibited at institutes in the
country, which contribute at most a disagreeable
odour to the education of the populace. But when
the bull-roarer warmed to its work, it justified its
name, producing what may best be described as a
mighty rushing noise, as if some supernatural being
&lsquo;fluttered and buzzed his wings with fearful roar.&rsquo;
Grown-up people, of course, are satisfied with a very
brief experience of this din, but boys have always
known the bull-roarer in England as one of the most
efficient modes of making the hideous and unearthly
noises in which it is the privilege of youth to delight.</p>

<p>The bull-roarer has, of all toys, the widest diffusion,
and the most extraordinary history. To study the
bull-roarer is to take a lesson in folklore. The instrument
is found among the most widely severed
peoples, savage and civilised, and is used in the celebration
of savage and civilised mysteries. There are
students who would found on this a hypothesis that
the various races that use the bull-roarer all descend
from the same stock. But the bull-roarer is introduced
here for the very purpose of showing that
similar minds, working with simple means towards
similar ends, might evolve the bull-roarer and its
mystic uses anywhere. There is no need for a hypothesis
of common origin, or of borrowing, to account
for this widely diffused sacred object.</p>

<p>The bull-roarer has been, and is, a sacred and
magical instrument in many and widely separated
lands. It is found, always as a sacred instrument,
employed in religious mysteries, in New Mexico, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
Australia, in New Zealand, in ancient Greece, and in
Africa; while, as we have seen, it is a peasant boy&rsquo;s
plaything in England. A number of questions are
naturally suggested by the bull-roarer. Is it a thing
invented once for all, and carried abroad over the
world by wandering races, or handed on from one
people and tribe to another? Or is the bull-roarer
a toy that might be accidentally hit on in any country
where men can sharpen wood and twist the sinews
of animals into string? Was the thing originally a
toy, and is its religious and mystical nature later; or
was it originally one of the properties of the priest, or
medicine-man, which in England has dwindled to a
plaything? Lastly, was this mystical instrument at
first employed in the rites of a civilised people like
the Greeks, and was it in some way borrowed or
inherited by South Africans, Australians, and New
Mexicans? Or is it a mere savage invention, surviving
(like certain other features of the Greek mysteries)
from a distant state of savagery? Our answer to all
these questions is that in all probability the presence
of the <ins class="greek" title="rhombos">&#8165;&#8057;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#962;</ins>, or bull-roarer, in Greek mysteries was
a survival from the time when Greeks were in the
social condition of Australians.</p>

<p>In the first place the bull-roarer is associated with
mysteries and initiations. Now mysteries and initiations
are things that tend to dwindle and to lose
their characteristic features as civilisation advances.
The rites of baptism and confirmation are not secret
and hidden; they are common to both sexes, they
are publicly performed, and religion and morality of
the purest sort blend in these ceremonies. There are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
no other initiations or mysteries that civilised modern
man is expected necessarily to pass through. On
the other hand, looking widely at human history, we
find mystic rites and initiations numerous, stringent,
severe, and magical in character, in proportion to the
lack of civilisation in those who practise them. The
less the civilisation, the more mysterious and the more
cruel are the rites. The more cruel the rites, the less
is the civilisation. The red hot poker with which
Mr. Bouncer terrified Mr. Verdant Green at the sham
masonic rites would have been quite in place, a
natural instrument of probationary torture, in the
Freemasonry of Australians, Mandans, or Hottentots.
In the mysteries of Demeter or Bacchus, in the mysteries
of a civilised people, the red-hot poker, or any
other instrument of torture, would have been out of
place. But in the Greek mysteries, just as in those
of South Africans, Red Indians, and Australians, the
disgusting practice of bedaubing the neophyte with
dirt and clay was preserved. We have nothing quite
like that in modern initiations. Except at Sparta,
Greeks dropped the tortures inflicted on boys and
girls in the initiations superintended by the cruel
Artemis.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But Greek mysteries retained the daubing
with mud and the use of the bull-roarer. On the
whole, then, and on a general view of the subject, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
prefer to think that the bull-roarer in Greece was a
survival from savage mysteries, not that the bull-roarer
in New Mexico, New Zealand, Australia, and
South Africa is a relic of civilisation.</p>

<p>Let us next observe a remarkable peculiarity of
the <i>turndun</i>, or Australian bull-roarer. The bull-roarer
in England is a toy. In Australia, according
to Howitt and Fison,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> the bull-roarer is regarded with
religious awe. &lsquo;When, on lately meeting with two of
the surviving Kurnai, I spoke to them of the turndun,
they first looked cautiously round them to see that
no one else was looking, and then answered me in
undertones.&rsquo; The chief peculiarity in connection with
the turndun is that women may never look upon it.
The Chepara tribe, who call it <i>bribbun</i>, have a custom
that, &lsquo;if seen by a woman, or shown by a man to a
woman, the punishment to both is <em>death</em>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Among the Kurnai, the sacred mystery of the
turndun is preserved by a legend, which gives a supernatural
sanction to secrecy. When boys go through
the mystic ceremony of initiation they are shown
turnduns, or bull-roarers, and made to listen to their
hideous din. They are then told that, if ever a
woman is allowed to see a turndun, the earth will
open, and water will cover the globe. The old men
point spears at the boy&rsquo;s eyes, saying: &lsquo;If you tell
this to any woman you will die, you will see the
ground broken up and like the sea; if you tell this
to any woman, or to any child, you will be killed!&rsquo;
As in Athens, in Syria, and among the Mandans,
the deluge-tradition of Australia is connected with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
mysteries. In Gippsland there is a tradition of the
deluge. &lsquo;Some children of the Kurnai in playing
about found a turndun, which they took home to
the camp and showed the women. Immediately the
earth crumbled away, and it was all water, and the
Kurnai were drowned.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In consequence of all this mummery the Australian
women attach great sacredness to the very
name of the turndun. They are much less instructed
in their own theology than the men of the tribe.
One woman believed she had heard Pundjel, the
chief supernatural being, descend in a mighty rushing
noise, that is, in the sound of the turndun, when boys
were being &lsquo;made men,&rsquo; or initiated.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> On turnduns
the Australian sorcerers can fly up to heaven. Turnduns
carved with imitations of water-flowers are
used by medicine-men in rain-making.
New Zealand also
has her bull-roarers; some of
them, carved in relief, are in
the Christy Museum, and one
is engraved here. I have no
direct evidence as to the use
of these Maori bull-roarers in
the Maori mysteries. Their employment,
however, may perhaps
be provisionally inferred.</p>

</div>

<p>One can readily believe that the New Zealand
bull-roarer may be whirled by any man who is repeating
a <i>Karakia</i>, or &lsquo;charm to raise the wind&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In New Zealand<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> &lsquo;the natives regarded the wind as
an indication of the presence of their god,&rsquo; a superstition
not peculiar to Maori religion. The &lsquo;cold
wind&rsquo; felt blowing over the hands at spiritualistic
<i>s&eacute;ances</i> is also regarded (by physical researchers) as
an indication of the presence of supernatural beings.
The windy roaring noise made by the bull-roarer
might readily be considered by savages, either as an
invitation to a god who should present himself in
storm, or as a proof of his being at hand. We have
seen that this view was actually taken by an Australian
woman. The hymn called &lsquo;breath&rsquo; or <i>haha</i>, a
hymn to the mystic wind, is pronounced by Maori
priests at the moment of the initiation of young men
in the tribal mysteries. It is a mere conjecture, and
possibly enough capable of disproof, but we have a
suspicion that the use of the <i>mystica vannus Iacchi</i>
was a mode of raising a sacred wind analogous to that
employed by whirlers of the turndun.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Servius, the ancient commentator on Virgil,

mentions, among other opinions, this&mdash;that the <i>vannus</i> was
a sieve, and that it symbolised the purifying effect of
the mysteries. But it is clear that Servius was only
guessing; and he offers other explanations, among
them that the <i>vannus</i> was a crate to hold offerings,
<i>primitias frugum</i>.</p>

<p>We have studied the bull-roarer in Australia, we
have caught a glimpse of it in England. Its existence
on the American continent is proved by letters
from New Mexico, and by the passage in Mr. Frank
Cushing&rsquo;s <i>Adventures in Zuni</i>.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In Zuni, too, among
a semi-civilised Indian tribe, or rather a tribe which
has left the savage for the barbaric condition, we
find the bull-roarer.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Here, too, the instrument&mdash;a
&lsquo;slat,&rsquo; Mr. Cushing calls it&mdash;is used as a call to
the ceremonial observance of the tribal ritual. The
Zunis have various &lsquo;orders of a more or less sacred
and sacerdotal character.&rsquo; Mr. Cushing writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>These orders were engaged in their annual ceremonials,
of which little was told or shown me; but, at the end of
four days, I heard one morning a <em>deep whirring noise</em>.
Running out, I saw a procession of three priests of the bow,
in plumed helmets and closely-fitting cuirasses, both of thick
buckskin&mdash;gorgeous and solemn with sacred embroideries
and war-paint, begirt with bows, arrows, and war-clubs, and
each distinguished by his badge of degree&mdash;coming down
one of the narrow streets. The principal priest carried in
his arms a wooden idol, ferocious in aspect, yet beautiful
with its decorations of shell, turquoise, and brilliant paint.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
It was nearly hidden by symbolic slats and prayer-sticks most
elaborately plumed. He was preceded by a guardian with
drawn bow and arrows, while another followed, <em>twirling the
sounding slat</em>, which had attracted alike my attention and
that of hundreds of the Indians, who hurriedly flocked to
the roofs of the adjacent houses, or lined the street, bowing
their heads in adoration, and scattering sacred prayer-meal
on the god and his attendant priests. Slowly they wound
their way down the hill, across the river, and off toward
the mountain of Thunder. Soon an identical procession
followed and took its way toward the western hills. I
watched them long until they disappeared, and a few hours
afterward there arose from the top of &lsquo;Thunder Mountain&rsquo;
a dense column of smoke, simultaneously with another from
the more distant western mesa of &lsquo;U-ha-na-mi,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Mount
of the Beloved.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then they told me that for four days I must neither
touch nor eat flesh or oil of any kind, and for ten days
neither throw any refuse from my doors nor permit a spark
to leave my house, for &lsquo;This was the season of the year
when the &ldquo;grandmother of men&rdquo; (fire) was precious.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Here then, in Zuni, we have the bull-roarer again,
and once more we find it employed as a summons to
the mysteries. We do not learn, however, that women
in Zuni are forbidden to look upon the bull-roarer.
Finally, the South African evidence, which is supplied
by letters from a correspondent of Mr. Tylor&rsquo;s, proves
that in South Africa, too, the bull-roarer is employed
to call the men to the celebration of secret
functions. A minute description of the instrument,
and of its magical power to raise a wind, is given
in Theal&rsquo;s <i>Kaffir Folklore</i>, p. 209. The bull-roarer
has not been made a subject of particular research;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
very probably later investigations will find it in other
parts of the modern world besides America, Africa,
New Zealand, and Australia. I have myself been
fortunate enough to encounter the bull-roarer on the
soil of ancient Greece and in connection with the
Dionysiac mysteries. Clemens of Alexandria, and
Arnobius, an early Christian father who follows
Clemens, describe certain toys of the child Dionysus
which were used in the mysteries. Among these
are <i>turbines</i>, <ins class="greek" title="k&ocirc;noi">&#954;&#8182;&#957;&#959;&#953;</ins> and <ins class="greek" title="rhomboi">&#8165;&#8057;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#953;</ins>. The ordinary dictionaries
interpret all these as whipping-tops, adding
that <ins class="greek" title="rhombos">&#8165;&#8057;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#962;</ins> is sometimes &lsquo;a magic wheel.&rsquo; The
ancient scholiast on Clemens, however, writes: &lsquo;The
<ins class="greek" title="k&ocirc;nos">&#954;&#8182;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins> is a little piece of wood, to which a string is
fastened, and in the mysteries it is whirled round to
make a roaring noise.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Here, in short, we have a
brief but complete description of the bull-roarer of
the Australian <i>turndun</i>. No single point is omitted.
The <ins class="greek" title="k&ocirc;nos">&#954;&#8182;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>, like the <i>turndun</i>, is a small object of wood,
it is tied to a string, when whirled round it produces
a roaring noise, and it is used at initiations. This is
not the end of the matter.</p>

<p>In the part of the Dionysiac mysteries at which
the toys of the child Dionysus were exhibited, and
during which (as it seems) the <ins class="greek" title="k&ocirc;nos">&#954;&#8182;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>, or bull-roarer,
was whirred, the performers daubed themselves all
over with clay. This we learn from a passage in
which Demosthenes describes the youth of his hated
adversary, &AElig;schines. The mother of &AElig;schines, he
says, was a kind of &lsquo;wise woman,&rsquo; and dabbler in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
mysteries. &AElig;schines used to aid her by bedaubing
the initiate over with clay and bran.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The word
<ins class="greek" title="hapomatt&ocirc;n">&#7937;&#960;&#959;&#956;&#8049;&#964;&#964;&#969;&#957;</ins>, here used by Demosthenes, is explained
by Harpocration as the ritual term for daubing the
initiated. A story was told as usual, to explain this
rite. It was said that, when the Titans attacked
Dionysus and tore him to pieces, they painted themselves
first with clay, or gypsum, that they might
not be recognised. Nonnus shows, in several places,
that down to his time the celebrants of the Bacchic
mysteries retained this dirty trick. Precisely the
same trick prevails in the mysteries of savage peoples.
Mr. Winwood Reade<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> reports the evidence of Mongilomba.
When initiated, Mongilomba was &lsquo;severely
flogged in the Fetich House&rsquo; (as young Spartans were
flogged before the animated image of Artemis), and
then he was &lsquo;plastered over with goat-dung.&rsquo; Among
the natives of Victoria,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> the &lsquo;body of the initiated is
bedaubed with clay, mud, charcoal powder, and filth
of every kind.&rsquo; The girls are plastered with charcoal
powder and white clay, answering to the Greek gypsum.
Similar daubings were performed at the mysteries by
the Mandans, as described by Catlin: and the Zunis
made raids on Mr. Cushing&rsquo;s black paint and Chinese
ink for like purposes. On the Congo, Mr. Johnson
found precisely the same ritual in the initiations.
Here, then, not to multiply examples, we discover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
two singular features in common between Greek and
savage mysteries. Both Greeks and savages employ
the bull-roarer, both bedaub the initiated with dirt or
with white paint or chalk. As to the meaning of the
latter very un-Aryan practice, one has no idea, unless it
represents the impure uninitiated condition, cleansed
later by ceremonies of initiation. It is only certain that
war parties of Australian blacks bedaub themselves
with white clay to alarm their enemies in night attacks.
The Phocians, according to Herodotus (viii. 27), adopted
the same &lsquo;aisy stratagem,&rsquo; as Captain Costigan
has it. Tellies, the medicine-man (<ins class="greek" title="mantis">&#956;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#962;</ins>), chalked
some sixty Phocians, whom he sent to make a night
attack on the Thessalians. The sentinels of the latter
were seized with supernatural horror, and fled, &lsquo;and
after the sentinels went the army.&rsquo; In the same way, in
a night attack among the Australian Kurnai,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> &lsquo;they all
rapidly painted themselves with pipe-clay: red ochre is
no use, it cannot frighten the enemy.&rsquo; If, then, Greeks
in the historic period kept up Australian tactics, it is
probable that the ancient mysteries of Greece might
retain the habit of daubing the initiated which occurs
in savage rites.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come now,&rsquo; as Herodotus would say, &lsquo;I will show
once more that the mysteries of the Greeks resemble
those of Bushmen.&rsquo; In Lucian&rsquo;s Treatise on Dancing,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
we read, &lsquo;I pass over the fact that you cannot find a
single ancient mystery in which there is not dancing....
To prove this I will not mention the secret acts
of worship, on account of the uninitiated. But this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
much all men know, that most people say of those
who reveal the mysteries, that they &ldquo;dance them out.&rdquo;&rsquo;
Here Liddel and Scott write, rather weakly, &lsquo;to dance
out, let out, betray, probably of some dance which
burlesqued these ceremonies.&rsquo; It is extremely improbable
that, in an age when it was still forbidden
to reveal the <ins class="greek" title="orgia">&#8004;&#961;&#947;&#953;&#945;</ins>, or secret rites, those rites would
be mocked in popular burlesques. Lucian obviously
intends to say that the matter of the mysteries was
set forth in <i>ballets d&rsquo;action</i>. Now this is exactly the
case in the surviving mysteries of the Bushmen.
Shortly after the rebellion of Langalibalele&rsquo;s tribe,
Mr. Orpen, the chief magistrate in St. John&rsquo;s Territory,
made the acquaintance of Qing, one of the last of an
all but exterminated tribe. Qing &lsquo;had never seen a
white man, except fighting,&rsquo; when he became Mr.
Orpen&rsquo;s guide. He gave a good deal of information
about the myths of his people, but refused to answer
certain questions. &lsquo;You are now asking the secrets
that are not spoken of.&rsquo; Mr. Orpen asked, &lsquo;Do you
know the secrets?&rsquo; Qing replied, &lsquo;No, only the initiated
men of that dance know these things.&rsquo; To &lsquo;dance&rsquo;
this or that means, &lsquo;to be acquainted with this or that
mystery;&rsquo; the dances were originally taught by Cagn,
the mantis, or grasshopper god. In many mysteries,
Qing, as a young man, was not initiated. He could
not &lsquo;dance them out.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>There are thus undeniably close resemblances
between the Greek mysteries and those of the lowest
contemporary races.</p>

<p>As to the bull-roarer, its recurrence among Greeks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
Zunis, Kamilaroi, Maoris, and South African races,
would be regarded by some students as a proof that
all these tribes had a common origin, or had borrowed
the instrument from each other. But this theory is
quite unnecessary. The bull-roarer is a very simple
invention. Any one might find out that a bit of
sharpened wood, tied to a string, makes, when
whirred, a roaring noise. Supposing that discovery
made, it is soon turned to practical use. All tribes
have their mysteries. All want a signal to summon
the right persons together, and warn the wrong persons
to keep out of the way. The church bell does as much
for us, so did the shaken <i>seistrum</i> for the Egyptians.
People with neither bells nor <i>seistra</i> find the bull-roarer,
with its mysterious sound, serve their turn.
The hiding of the instrument from women is natural
enough. It merely makes the alarm and absence of
the curious sex doubly sure. The stories of supernatural
consequences to follow if a woman sees the
turndun lend a sanction. This is not a random theory,
without basis. In Brazil the natives have no bull-roarer,
but they have mysteries, and the presence of
the women at the mysteries of the men is a terrible
impiety. To warn away the women the Brazilians
make loud &lsquo;devil-music&rsquo; on what are called &lsquo;jurupari
pipes.&rsquo; Now, just as in Australia, <em>the women may not
see the jurupari pipes on pain of death</em>. When the
sound of the jurupari pipes is heard, as when the
turndun is heard in Australia, every woman flees and
hides herself. The women are always executed if
they see the pipes. Mr. Alfred Wallace bought a
pair of these pipes, but he had to embark them at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
a distance from the village where they were procured.
The seller was afraid that some unknown misfortune
would occur if the women of his village set eyes on
the juruparis.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The conclusion from all these facts seems obvious.
The bull-roarer is an instrument easily invented by
savages, and easily adopted into the ritual of savage
mysteries. If we find the bull-roarer used in the
mysteries of the most civilised of ancient peoples,
the most probable explanation is, that the Greeks
retained both the mysteries, the bull-roarer, the habit
of bedaubing the initiate, the torturing of boys, the
sacred obscenities, the antics with serpents, the dances,
and the like, from the time when their ancestors were
in the savage condition. That more refined and
religious ideas were afterwards introduced into the
mysteries seems certain, but the rites were in many
cases simply savage. Unintelligible (except as survivals)
when found among Hellenes, they become
intelligible enough among savages, because they correspond
to the intellectual condition and magical
fancies of the lower barbarism. The same sort
of comparison, the same kind of explanation, will
account, as we shall see, for the savage myths as well
as for the savage customs which survived among the
Greeks.</p>

Pausanias, iii. 15. When the boys were being cruelly scourged,
the priestess of Artemis Orthia held an ancient barbaric wooden image

heavy; the more they were tortured, the lighter grew the image. In
Samoa the image (shark&rsquo;s teeth) of the god Taema is consulted before

This is not the view of le P&egrave;re Lafitau, a learned Jesuit missionary
in North America, who wrote (1724) a work on savage manners,
compared with the manners of heathen antiquity. Lafitau, who was
greatly struck with the resemblances between Greek and Iroquois or
Carib initiations, takes Servius&rsquo;s other explanation of the <i>mystica

<h2><a name="chap03" id="chap03"></a><i>THE MYTH OF CRONUS.</i></h2>


<p>In a Maori pah, when a little boy behaves rudely to
his parents, he is sometimes warned that he is &lsquo;as
bad as cruel Tutenganahau.&rsquo; If he asks who Tutenganahau
was, he is told the following story:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;In the beginning, the Heaven, Rangi, and the
Earth, Papa, were the father and mother of all things.
&ldquo;In these days the Heaven lay upon the Earth, and
all was darkness. They had never been separated.&rdquo;
Heaven and Earth had children, who grew up and
lived in this thick night, and they were unhappy
because they could not see. Between the bodies of
their parents they were imprisoned, and there was no
light. The names of the children were Tumatuenga,
Tane Mahuta, Tutenganahau, and some others. So
they all consulted as to what should be done with their
parents, Rangi and Papa. &ldquo;Shall we slay them, or
shall we separate them?&rdquo; &ldquo;Go to,&rdquo; said Tumatuenga,
&ldquo;let us slay them.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Tane Mahuta, &ldquo;let us
rather separate them. Let one go upwards, and become
a stranger to us; let the other remain below,
and be a parent to us.&rdquo; Only Tawhiri Matea (the
wind) had pity on his own father and mother. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
the fruit-gods, and the war-god, and the sea-god (for
all the children of Papa and Rangi were gods) tried
to rend their parents asunder. Last rose the forest-god,
cruel Tutenganahau. He severed the sinews
which united Heaven and Earth, Rangi and Papa.
Then he pushed hard with his head and feet. Then
wailed Heaven and exclaimed Earth, &ldquo;Wherefore this
murder? Why this great sin? Why destroy us?
Why separate us?&rdquo; But Tane pushed and pushed:
Rangi was driven far away into the air. &ldquo;<em>They became
visible, who had hitherto been concealed between
the hollows of their parents&rsquo; breasts.</em>&rdquo; Only the storm-god
differed from his brethren: he arose and followed
his father, Rangi, and abode with him in the
open spaces of the sky.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This is the Maori story of the severing of the
wedded Heaven and Earth. The cutting of them
asunder was the work of Tutenganahau and his
brethren, and the conduct of Tutenganahau is still
held up as an example of filial impiety.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The story
is preserved in sacred hymns of very great antiquity,
and many of the myths are common to the other
peoples of the Pacific.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Now let us turn from New Zealand to Athens, as
she was in the days of Pericles. Socrates is sitting
in the porch of the King Archon, when Euthyphro
comes up and enters into conversation with the philosopher.
After some talk, Euthyphro says, &lsquo;You will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
think me mad when I tell you whom I am prosecuting
and pursuing!&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, has the fugitive
wings?&rsquo; asks Socrates. &lsquo;Nay, he is not very volatile
at his time of life!&rsquo; &lsquo;Who is he?&rsquo; &lsquo;My father.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Good heavens! you don&rsquo;t mean that. What is he
accused of?&rsquo; &lsquo;Murder, Socrates.&rsquo; Then Euthyphro
explains the case, which quaintly illustrates Greek
civilisation. Euthyphro&rsquo;s father had an agricultural
labourer at Naxos. One day this man, in a drunken
passion, killed a slave. Euthyphro&rsquo;s father seized the
labourer, bound him, threw him into a ditch, &lsquo;and
then sent to Athens to ask a diviner what should be
done with him.&rsquo; Before the answer of the diviner
arrived, the labourer literally &lsquo;died in a ditch&rsquo; of
hunger and cold. For this offence, Euthyphro was
prosecuting his own father. Socrates shows that he
disapproves, and Euthyphro thus defends the piety of
his own conduct: &lsquo;The impious, whoever he may be,
ought not to go unpunished. For do not men regard
Zeus as the best and most righteous of gods? Yet
even they admit that Zeus bound his own father
Cronus, because he wickedly devoured his sons; and
that Cronus, too, had punished his own father, Uranus,
for a similar reason, in a nameless manner. And
yet when <em>I</em> proceed against <em>my</em> father, people are
angry with me. This is their inconsistent way of
talking, when the gods are concerned, and when I
am concerned.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Here Socrates breaks in. He &lsquo;cannot away with
these stories about the gods,&rsquo; and so he has just
been accused of impiety, the charge for which he died.
Socrates cannot believe that a god, Cronus, mutilated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
his father Uranus, but Euthyphro believes the whole
affair: &lsquo;I can tell you many other things about the
gods which would quite amaze you.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>


<p class="hrpad">We have here a typical example of the way in
which mythology puzzled the early philosophers of
Greece. Socrates was anxious to be pious, and to
respect the most ancient traditions of the gods. Yet
at the very outset of sacred history he was met by
tales of gods who mutilated and bound their own
parents. Not only were such tales hateful to him,
but they were of positively evil example to people
like Euthyphro. The problem remained, how did
the fathers of the Athenians ever come to tell such
myths?</p>


<p class="hrpad">Let us now examine the myth of Cronus, and the
explanations which have been given by scholars.
Near the beginning of things, according to Hesiod
(whose cosmogony was accepted in Greece), Earth
gave birth to Heaven. Later, Heaven, Uranus, became
the husband of G&aelig;a, Earth. Just as Rangi
and Papa, in New Zealand, had many children, so
had Uranus and G&aelig;a. As in New Zealand, some
of these children were gods of the various elements.
Among them were Oceanus, the deep, and Hyperion,
the sun&mdash;as among the children of Earth and Heaven,
in New Zealand, were the Wind and the Sea. The
youngest child of the Greek Heaven and Earth was
&lsquo;Cronus of crooked counsel, who ever hated his
mighty sire.&rsquo; Now even as the children of the Maori
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
Heaven and Earth were &lsquo;concealed between the
hollows of their parents&rsquo; breasts,&rsquo; so the Greek Heaven
used to &lsquo;hide his children from the light in the hollows
of Earth.&rsquo; Both Earth and her children resented this,
and, as in New Zealand, the children conspired against
Heaven, taking Earth, however, into their counsels.
Thereupon Earth produced iron, and bade her children
avenge their wrongs.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Now fear fell on all of them,
except Cronus, who, like Tutenganahau, was all for
action. Cronus determined to end the embraces of
Heaven and Earth. But, while the Maori myth conceives
of Heaven and Earth as of two beings which
have never been separated before, Hesiod makes
Heaven amorously approach his wife from a distance.
Then Cronus stretched out his hand, armed with a
sickle of iron, or steel, and mutilated Uranus. Thus
were Heaven and Earth practically divorced. But
as in the Maori myth one of the children of Heaven
clave to his sire, so, in Greek, Oceanus remained
faithful to his father.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>This is the first portion of the myth of Cronus.
Can it be denied that the story is well illustrated and
explained by the New Zealand parallel, the myth of
the cruelty of Tutenganahau? By means of this comparison,
the meaning of the myth is made clear enough.
Just as the New Zealanders had conceived of Heaven
and Earth as at one time united, to the prejudice of
their children, so the ancestors of the Greeks had
believed in an ancient union of Heaven and Earth.
Both by Greeks and Maoris, Heaven and Earth were
thought of as living persons, with human parts and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
passions. Their union was prejudicial to their children,
and so the children violently separated the parents.
This conduct is regarded as impious, and as an awful
example to be avoided, in Maori pahs. In Naxos,
on the other hand, Euthyphro deemed that the conduct
of Cronus deserved imitation. If ever the Maoris
had reached a high civilisation, they would probably
have been revolted, like Socrates, by the myth which
survived from their period of savagery. Mr. Tylor
well says,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> &lsquo;Just as the adzes of polished jade, and the
cloaks of tied flax-fibre, which these New Zealanders
were using but yesterday, are older in their place in
history than the bronze battle-axes and linen mummy-cloths
of ancient Egypt, so the Maori poet&rsquo;s shaping
of nature into nature-myth belongs to a stage of intellectual
history which was passing away in Greece
five-and-twenty centuries ago. The myth-maker&rsquo;s
fancy of Heaven and Earth as father and mother of
all things naturally suggested the legend that they
in old days abode together, but have since been torn
asunder.&rsquo;</p>


<p class="hrpad">That this view of Heaven and Earth is natural to
early minds, Mr. Tylor proves by the presence of the
myth of the union and violent divorce of the pair in
China.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Puang-ku is the Chinese Cronus, or Tutenganahau.
In India,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Dyaus and Prithivi, Heaven
and Earth, were once united, and were severed by
Indra, their own child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
This, then, is our interpretation of the exploit of
Cronus. It is an old surviving nature-myth of the
severance of Heaven and Earth, a myth found in
China, India, New Zealand, as well as in Greece.
Of course it is not pretended that Chinese and Maoris
borrowed from Indians and Greeks, or came originally
of the same stock. Similar phenomena, presenting
themselves to be explained by human minds in a
similar stage of fancy and of ignorance, will account
for the parallel myths.</p>

<p>The second part of the myth of Cronus was, like
the first, a stumbling-block to the orthodox in Greece.
Of the second part we offer no explanation beyond
the fact that the incidents in the myth are almost
universally found among savages, and that, therefore,
in Greece they are probably survivals from savagery.
The sequel of the myth appears to account for
nothing, as the first part accounts for the severance
of Heaven and Earth. In the sequel a world-wide
<i>M&auml;rchen</i>, or tale, seems to have been attached to
Cronus, or attracted into the cycle of which he is
centre, without any particular reason, beyond the
law which makes detached myths crystallise round
any celebrated name. To look further is, perhaps,
<i>chercher raison o&ugrave; il n&rsquo;y en a pas</i>.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the story of Cronus runs thus:
He wedded his sister, Rhea, and begat children&mdash;Demeter,
Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and, lastly, Zeus.
&lsquo;And mighty Cronus swallowed down each of them,
each that came to their mother&rsquo;s knees from her holy
womb, with this intent, that none other of the proud
children of Uranus should hold kingly sway among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
the Immortals.&rsquo; Cronus showed a ruling father&rsquo;s usual
jealousy of his heirs. It was a case of Friedrich
Wilhelm and Friedrich. But Cronus (acting in a way
natural in a story perhaps first invented by cannibals)
swallowed his children instead of merely imprisoning
them. Heaven and Earth had warned him to beware
of his heirs, and he could think of no safer plan than
that which he adopted. When Rhea was about to
become the mother of Zeus, she fled to Crete. Here
Zeus was born, and when Cronus (in pursuit of his
usual policy) asked for the baby, he was presented
with a stone wrapped up in swaddling bands. After
swallowing the stone, Cronus was easy in his mind;
but Zeus grew up, administered a dose to his father,
and compelled him to disgorge. &lsquo;The stone came
forth first, as he had swallowed it last.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The other
children also emerged, all alive and well. Zeus
fixed the stone at Delphi, where, long after the
Christian era, Pausanias saw it.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> It was not a large
stone, Pausanias tells us, and the Delphians used to
anoint it with oil and wrap it up in wool on feast-days.
All Greek temples had their fetich-stones, and each
stone had its legend. This was the story of the
Delphian stone, and of the fetichism which survived
the early years of Christianity. A very pretty story
it is. Savages more frequently smear their fetich-stones
with red paint than daub them with oil, but
the latter, as we learn from Theophrastus&rsquo; account
of the &lsquo;superstitious man,&rsquo; was the Greek ritual.</p>


<p class="hrpad">This anecdote about Cronus was the stumbling-block
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
of the orthodox Greek, the jest of the sceptic,
and the butt of the early Christian controversialists.
Found among Bushmen or Australians the narrative
might seem rather wild, but it astonishes us still more
when it occurs in the holy legends of Greece. Our
explanation of its presence there is simple enough.
Like the erratic blocks in a modern plain, like the
flint-heads in a meadow, the story is a relic of a very
distant past. The glacial age left the boulders on
the plain, the savage tribes of long ago left the arrow-heads,
the period of savage fancy left the story of
Cronus and the rites of the fetich-stone. Similar
rites are still notoriously practised in the South Sea
Islands, in Siberia, in India and Africa and Melanesia,
by savages. And by savages similar tales are
still told.</p>


<p class="hrpad">We cannot go much lower than the Bushmen, and
among Bushman divine myths is room for the &lsquo;swallowing
trick&rsquo; attributed to Cronus by Hesiod. The
chief divine character in Bushman myth is the Mantis
insect. His adopted daughter is the child of Kwai
Hemm, a supernatural character, &lsquo;the all-devourer.&rsquo;
The Mantis gets his adopted daughter to call the
swallower to his aid; but Kwai Hemm swallows the
Mantis, the god-insect. As Zeus made his own wife
change herself into an insect, for the convenience of
swallowing her, there is not much difference between
Bushman and early Greek mythology. Kwai Hemm
is killed by a stratagem, and all the animals whom he
has got outside of, in a long and voracious career,
troop forth from him alive and well, like the swallowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
gods from the maw of Cronus.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Now, story for story,
the Bushman version is much less offensive than that
of Hesiod. But the Bushman story is just the sort
of story we expect from Bushmen, whereas the
Hesiodic story is not at all the kind of tale we look
for from Greeks. The explanation is, that the Greeks
had advanced out of a savage state of mind and
society, but had retained their old myths, myths
evolved in the savage stage, and in harmony with
that condition of fancy. Among the Kaffirs<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> we find
the same &lsquo;swallow-myth.&rsquo; The Igongqongqo swallows
all and sundry; a woman cuts the swallower with
a knife, and &lsquo;people came out, and cattle, and dogs.&rsquo;
In Australia, a god is swallowed. As in the myth
preserved by Aristophanes in the &lsquo;Birds,&rsquo; the Australians
believe that birds were the original gods, and
the eagle, especially, is a great creative power. The
Moon was a mischievous being, who walked about
the world, doing what evil he could. One day he
swallowed the eagle-god. The wives of the eagle
came up, and the Moon asked them where he might
find a well. They pointed out a well, and, as he
drank, they hit the Moon with a stone tomahawk, and
out flew the eagle.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> This is oddly like Grimm&rsquo;s tale
of &lsquo;The Wolf and the Kids.&rsquo; The wolf swallowed
the kids, their mother cut a hole in the wolf, let out
the kids, stuffed the wolf with stones, and sewed him
up again. The wolf went to the well to drink, the
weight of the stones pulled him in, and he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
drowned. Similar stories are common among the
Red Indians, and Mr. Im Thurn has found them in
Guiana. How savages all over the world got the
idea that men and beasts could be swallowed and
disgorged alive, and why they fashioned the idea
into a divine myth, it is hard to say. Mr. Tylor, in
<i>Primitive Culture</i>,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> adds many examples of the
narrative. The Basutos have it; it occurs some five
times in Callaway&rsquo;s <i>Zula Nursery Tales</i>. In Greenland
the Eskimo have a shape of the incident, and we
have all heard of the escape of Jonah.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that night, covering up the
world, gave the first idea of the swallowing myth.
Now in some of the stories the night is obviously
conceived of as a big beast which swallows all things.
The notion that night is an animal is entirely in harmony
with savage metaphysics. In the opinion of the
savage speculator, all things are men and animals.
&lsquo;Ils se persuadent que non seulement les hommes et
les autres animaux, mais aussi que toutes les autres
choses sont anim&eacute;es,&rsquo; says one of the old Jesuit missionaries
in Canada.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> &lsquo;The wind was formerly a
person; he became a bird,&rsquo; say the Bushmen.
<i>G&rsquo;&nbsp;o&ouml; ka! Kui</i> (a very respectable Bushman, whose
name seems a little hard to pronounce) once saw the
wind-person at Haarfontein.</p>

<p>Savages, then, are persuaded that night, sky, cloud,
fire, and so forth, are only the <i>schein</i>, or sensuous
appearance, of things that, in essence, are men or
animals. A good example is the bringing of Night to
Vanua Lava, by Qat, the &lsquo;culture-hero&rsquo; of Melanesia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
At first it was always day, and people tired of it.
Qat heard that Night was at the Torres Islands, and
he set forth to get some. Qong (Night) received Qat
well, blackened his eyebrows, showed him Sleep, and
sent him off with fowls to bring Dawn after the arrival
of Night should make Dawn a necessity. Next day
Qat&rsquo;s brothers saw the sun crawl away west, and
presently Night came creeping up from the sea. &lsquo;What
is this?&rsquo; cried the brothers. &lsquo;It is Night,&rsquo; said Qat;
&lsquo;sit down, and when you feel something in your eyes,
lie down and keep quiet.&rsquo; So they went to sleep. &lsquo;When
Night had lasted long enough, Qat took a piece of red
obsidian, and cut the darkness, and the Dawn came out.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Night is more or less personal in this tale, and
solid enough to be cut, so as to let the Dawn out.
This savage conception of Night, as the swallower
and disgorger, might start the notion of other swallowing
and disgorging beings. Again the Bushmen,
and other savage peoples, account for certain celestial
phenomena by saying that &lsquo;a big star has swallowed
his daughter, and spit her out again.&rsquo; While natural
phenomena, explained on savage principles, might
give the data of the swallow-myth, we must not conclude
that all beings to whom the story is attached
are, therefore, the Night. On this principle Cronus
would be the Night, and so would the wolf in Grimm.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
For our purposes it is enough that the feat of Cronus
is a feat congenial to the savage fancy and repugnant
to the civilised Greeks who found themselves
in possession of the myth. Beyond this, and beyond
the inference that the Cronus myth was first evolved
by people to whom it seemed quite natural, that is,
by savages, we do not pretend to go in our interpretation.</p>


<p class="hrpad">To end our examination of the myth of Cronus,
we may compare the solutions offered by scholars.
As a rule, these solutions are based on the philological
analysis of the names in the story. It will be
seen that very various and absolutely inconsistent
etymologies and meanings of Cronus are suggested
by philologists of the highest authority. These contradictions
are, unfortunately, rather the rule than
the exception in the etymological interpretation of
myths.</p>


<p class="hrpad">The opinion of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller has always a
right to the first hearing from English inquirers.
Mr. M&uuml;ller, naturally, examines first the name of the
god whose legend he is investigating. He writes:
&lsquo;There is no such being as Kronos in Sanskrit.
Kronos did not exist till long after Zeus in Greece.
Zeus was called by the Greeks the son of Time
(<ins class="greek" title="Kronos">&#922;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>). This is a very simple and very common
form of mythological expression. It meant originally,
not that time was the origin or source of Zeus, but
<ins class="greek" title="Kroni&ocirc;n">&#922;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#8055;&#969;&#957;</ins> or <ins class="greek" title="Kronid&ecirc;s">&#922;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#8055;&#948;&#951;&#962;</ins> was used in the sense of &ldquo;connected
with time, representing time, existing through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
all time.&rdquo; Derivatives in <ins class="greek" title="-i&ocirc;n">-&#953;&#969;&#957;</ins> and <ins class="greek" title="-id&ecirc;s">-&#953;&#948;&#951;&#962;</ins> took, in later
times, the more exclusive meaning of patronymics....
When this (the meaning of <ins class="greek" title="Kronid&ecirc;s">&#922;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#8055;&#948;&#951;&#962;</ins> as equivalent
to Ancient of Days) ceased to be understood, ...
people asked themselves the question, Why is <ins class="greek" title="Zeus">&#918;&#949;&#8059;&#962;</ins>
called <ins class="greek" title="Kronid&ecirc;s">&#922;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#8055;&#948;&#951;&#962;</ins>? And the natural and almost inevitable
answer was, Because he is the son, the offspring
of a more ancient god, <ins class="greek" title="Kronos">&#922;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>. This may be a very
old myth in Greece; but the misunderstanding
which gave rise to it could have happened in Greece
only. We cannot expect, therefore, a god <ins class="greek" title="Kronos">&#922;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins> in
the Veda.&rsquo; To expect Greek in the Veda would
certainly be sanguine. &lsquo;When this myth of <ins class="greek" title="Kronos">&#922;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>
had once been started, it would roll on irresistibly.
If <ins class="greek" title="Zeus">&#918;&#949;&#8059;&#962;</ins> had once a father called <ins class="greek" title="Kronos">&#922;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>, <ins class="greek" title="Kronos">&#922;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins> must
have a wife.&rsquo; It is added, as confirmation, that &lsquo;the
name of <ins class="greek" title="Kronid&ecirc;s">&#922;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#8055;&#948;&#951;&#962;</ins> belongs originally to Zeus only,
and not to his later&rsquo; (in Hesiod elder) &lsquo;brothers,
Poseidon and Hades.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Mr. M&uuml;ller says, in his famous essay on &lsquo;Comparative
Mythology&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>: &lsquo;How can we imagine that a
few generations before that time&rsquo; (the age of Solon)
&lsquo;the highest notions of the Godhead among the Greeks
were adequately expressed by the story of Uranus
maimed by Kronos,&mdash;of Kronos eating his children,
swallowing a stone, and vomiting out alive his whole
progeny? Among the lowest tribes of Africa and
America, we hardly find anything more hideous and
revolting.&rsquo; We have found a good deal of the sort
in Africa and America, where it seems not out of
place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
One objection to Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s theory is, that it
makes the mystery no clearer. When Greeks were
so advanced in Hellenism that their own early language
had become obsolete and obscure, they invented
the god <ins class="greek" title="Kronos">&#922;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>, to account for the patronymic (as
they deemed it) <ins class="greek" title="Kronid&ecirc;s">&#922;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#8055;&#948;&#951;&#962;</ins>, son of <ins class="greek" title="Kronos">&#922;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>. But why
did they tell such savage and revolting stories about
the god they had invented? Mr. M&uuml;ller only says
the myth &lsquo;would roll on irresistibly.&rsquo; But why did
the rolling myth gather such very strange moss?
That is the problem; and while Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s hypothesis
accounts for the existence of a god called
<ins class="greek" title="Kronos">&#922;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>, it does not even attempt to show how full-blown
Greeks came to believe such hideous stories
about the god.</p>


<p class="hrpad">This theory, therefore, is of no practical service.
The theory of Adalbert Kuhn, one of the most
famous of Sanskrit scholars, and author of <i>Die
Herabkunft des Feuers</i>, is directly opposed to the ideas
of Mr. M&uuml;ller. In Cronus, Mr. M&uuml;ller recognises a
god who could only have come into being among
Greeks, when the Greeks had begun to forget the
original meaning of &lsquo;derivatives in <ins class="greek" title="-i&ocirc;n">-&#953;&#969;&#957;</ins> and <ins class="greek" title="-id&ecirc;s">-&#953;&#948;&#951;&#962;</ins>.&rsquo;
Kuhn, on the other hand, derives <ins class="greek" title="Kronos">&#922;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins> from the
same root as the Sanskrit <i>Kr&#257;na</i>.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> <i>Kr&#257;na</i> means, it
appears, <i>der f&uuml;r sich schaffende</i>, he who creates for
himself, and Cronus is compared to the Indian
Pragapati, about whom even more abominable stories
are told than the myths which circulate to the prejudice
of Cronus. According to Kuhn, the &lsquo;swallow-myth&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
means that Cronus, the lord of light and dark
powers, swallows the divinities of light. But in place
of Zeus (that is, according to Kuhn, of the daylight
sky) he swallows a stone, that is the sun. When
he disgorges the stone (the sun), he also disgorges
the gods of light whom he had swallowed.</p>

<p>I confess that I cannot understand these distinctions
between the father and lord of light and dark
(Cronus) and the beings he swallowed. Nor do I
find it easy to believe that myth-making man took
all those distinctions, or held those views of the
Creator. However, the chief thing to note is that
Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s etymology and Kuhn&rsquo;s etymology of
Cronus can hardly both be true, which, as their systems
both depend on etymological analysis, is somewhat
discomfiting.</p>

<p>The next etymological theory is the daring
speculation of Mr. Brown. In <i>The Great Dionysiak
Myth</i><a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Mr. Brown writes: &lsquo;I regard Kronos as the
equivalent of Karnos, Karnaios, Karnaivis, the Horned
God; Assyrian, KaRNu; Hebrew, KeReN, horn;
Hellenic, KRoNos, or KaRNos.&rsquo; Mr. Brown seems
to think that Cronus is &lsquo;the ripening power of
harvest,&rsquo; and also &lsquo;a wily savage god,&rsquo; in which
opinion one quite agrees with him. Why the name
of Cronus should mean &lsquo;horned,&rsquo; when he is never represented
with horns, it is hard to say. But among
the various foreign gods in whom the Greeks recognised
their own Cronus, one Hea, &lsquo;regarded by
Berosos as Kronos,&rsquo; seems to have been &lsquo;horn-wearing.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Horns are lacking in Seb and Il, if not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
in Baal Hamon, though Mr. Brown would like to
behorn them.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to Preller.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> According to
Preller, <ins class="greek" title="Kronos">&#922;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins> is connected with <ins class="greek" title="krain&ocirc;">&#954;&#961;&#945;&#8055;&#957;&#969;</ins>, to fulfil, to
bring to completion. The harvest month, the month
of ripening and fulfilment, was called <ins class="greek" title="kroni&ocirc;n">&#954;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#8055;&#969;&#957;</ins> in
some parts of Greece, and the jolly harvest-feast, with
its memory of Saturn&rsquo;s golden days, was named
<ins class="greek" title="kronia">&#954;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#953;&#945;</ins>. The sickle of Cronus, the sickle of harvest-time,

<p>Preller illustrates the mutilation of Uranus by
the Maori tale of Tutenganahau. The child-swallowing
he connects with Punic and Ph&oelig;nician influence,
and Semitic sacrifices of men and children. Porphyry<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
speaks of human sacrifices to Cronus in
Rhodes, and the Greeks recognised Cronus in the
Carthaginian god to whom children were offered up.</p>

<p>Hartung<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> takes Cronus, when he mutilates
Uranus, to be the fire of the sun, scorching the sky
of spring. This, again, is somewhat out of accord
with Schwartz&rsquo;s idea, that Cronus is the storm-god,
the cloud-swallowing deity, his sickle the rainbow,
and the blood of Uranus the lightning.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> According
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
to Prof. Sayce, again,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> the blood-drops of Uranus are
rain-drops. Cronus is the sun-god, piercing the dark
cloud, which is just the reverse of Schwartz&rsquo;s idea.
Prof. Sayce sees points in common between the
legend of Moloch, or of Baal under the name of
Moloch, and the myth of Cronus. But Moloch, he
thinks, is not a god of Ph&oelig;nician origin, but a deity
borrowed from &lsquo;the primitive Accadian population
of Babylonia.&rsquo; Mr. Isaac Taylor, again, explains
Cronus as the sky which swallows and reproduces
the stars. The story of the sickle may be derived
from the crescent moon, the &lsquo;silver sickle,&rsquo; or from a
crescent-shaped piece of meteoric iron&mdash;for, in this
theory, the fetich-stone of Delphi is a piece of that
substance.</p>


<p class="hrpad">It will be observed that any one of these theories,
if accepted, is much more &lsquo;minute in detail&rsquo; than
our humble suggestion. He who adopts any one of
them, knows all about it. He knows that Cronus is
a purely Greek god, or that he is connected with the
Sanskrit <i>Kr&#257;na</i>, which Tiele,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> unhappily, says is &lsquo;a very
dubious word.&rsquo; Or the mythologist may be quite
confident that Cronus is neither Greek nor, in any
sense, Sanskrit, but Ph&oelig;nician. A not less adequate
interpretation assigns him ultimately to Accadia.
While the inquirer who can choose a system and
stick to it knows the exact nationality of Cronus, he
is also well acquainted with his character as a nature-god.
He may be Time, or perhaps he is the Summer
Heat, and a horned god; or he is the harvest-god, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
the god of storm and darkness, or the midnight sky,&mdash;the
choice is wide; or he is the lord of dark and
light, and his children are the stars, the clouds, the
summer months, the light-powers, or what you will.
The mythologist has only to make his selection.</p>

<p>The system according to which we tried to interpret
the myth is less <i>ondoyant et divers</i>. We do not
even pretend to explain everything. We do not
guess at the meaning and root of the word Cronus.
We only find parallels to the myth among savages,
whose mental condition is fertile in such legends.
And we only infer that the myth of Cronus was
originally evolved by persons also in the savage intellectual
condition. The survival we explain as, in a
previous essay, we explained the survival of the bull-roarer,
by the conservatism of the religious instinct.</p>

<h2><a name="chap04" id="chap04"></a><i>CUPID, PSYCHE, AND THE &lsquo;SUN-FROG.&rsquo;</i></h2>


<p>&lsquo;Once upon a time there lived a king and a queen,&rsquo;
says the old woman in Apuleius, beginning the tale
of Cupid and Psyche with that ancient formula which
has been dear to so many generations of children. In
one shape or other the tale of Cupid and Psyche, of
the woman who is forbidden to see or to name her
husband, of the man with the vanished fairy bride,
is known in most lands, &lsquo;even among barbarians.&rsquo;
According to the story the mystic prohibition is always
broken: the hidden face is beheld; light is brought
into the darkness; the forbidden name is uttered;
the bride is touched with the tabooed metal, iron, and
the union is ended. Sometimes the pair are re-united,
after long searchings and wanderings; sometimes
they are severed for ever. Such are the central
situations in tales like that of Cupid and Psyche.</p>

<p>In the attempt to discover how the ideas on which
this myth is based came into existence, we may
choose one of two methods. We may confine our
investigations to the Aryan peoples, among whom
the story occurs both in the form of myth and of
household tale. Again, we may look for the shapes
of the legend which hide, like Peau d&rsquo;Ane in disguise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
among the rude kraals and wigwams, and in the
strange and scanty garb of savages. If among savages
we find both narratives like Cupid and Psyche, and
also customs and laws out of which the myth might
have arisen, we may provisionally conclude that
similar customs once existed among the civilised
races who possess the tale, and that from these
sprang the early forms of the myth.</p>

<p>In accordance with the method hitherto adopted,
we shall prefer the second plan, and pursue our quest
beyond the limits of the Aryan peoples.</p>

<p>The oldest literary shape of the tale of Psyche
and her lover is found in the Rig Veda (x. 95). The
characters of a singular and cynical dialogue in that
poem are named Urvasi and Pururavas. The former
is an Apsaras, a kind of fairy or sylph, the mistress
(and a <i>folle ma&icirc;tresse</i>, too) of Pururavas, a mortal
man.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> In the poem Urvasi remarks that when she
dwelt among men she &lsquo;ate once a day a small piece
of butter, and therewith well satisfied went away.&rsquo;
This slightly reminds one of the common idea
that the living may not eat in the land of the dead,
and of Persephone&rsquo;s tasting the pomegranate in
Hades.</p>

<p>Of the dialogue in the Rig Veda it may be
said, in the words of Mr. Toots, that &lsquo;the language is
coarse and the meaning is obscure.&rsquo; We only gather
that Urvasi, though she admits her sensual content
in the society of Pururavas, is leaving him &lsquo;like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
first of the dawns&rsquo;; that she &lsquo;goes home again, hard
to be caught, like the winds.&rsquo; She gives her lover
some hope, however&mdash;that the gods promise immortality
even to him, &lsquo;the kinsman of Death&rsquo; as he is.
&lsquo;Let thine offspring worship the gods with an oblation;
in Heaven shalt thou too have joy of the
festival.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the Rig Veda, then, we dimly discern a parting
between a mortal man and an immortal bride,
and a promise of reconciliation.</p>

<p>The story, of which this Vedic poem is a partial
dramatisation, is given in the Brahmana of the Yajur
Veda. Mr. Max M&uuml;ller has translated the passage.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
According to the Brahmana, &lsquo;Urvasi, a kind of fairy,
fell in love with Pururavas, and when she met him
she said: Embrace me three times a day, but never
against my will, and let me never see you without
your royal garments, <em>for this is the manner of women</em>.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
The Gandharvas, a spiritual race, kinsmen of Urvasi,
thought she had lingered too long among men. They
therefore plotted some way of parting her from Pururavas.
Her covenant with her lord declared that she
was never to see him naked. If that compact were
broken she would be compelled to leave him. To
make Pururavas break this compact the Gandharvas
stole a lamb from beside Urvasi&rsquo;s bed: Pururavas
sprang up to rescue the lamb, and, in a flash of lightning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
Urvasi saw him naked, contrary to the <em>manner
of women</em>. She vanished. He sought her long, and
at last came to a lake where she and her fairy friends
were playing <em>in the shape of birds</em>. Urvasi saw Pururavas,
revealed herself to him, and, according to the
Brahmana, part of the strange Vedic dialogue was
now spoken. Urvasi promised to meet him on the
last night of the year: a son was to be the result
of the interview. Next day, her kinsfolk, the Gandharvas,
offered Pururavas the wish of his heart. He
wished to be one of them. They then initiated him
into the mode of kindling a certain sacred fire, after
which he became immortal and dwelt among the
Gandharvas.</p>

<p>It is highly characteristic of the Indian mind that
the story should be thus worked into connection with
ritual. In the same way the Bhagavata Purana has
a long, silly, and rather obscene narrative about the
sacrifice offered by Pururavas, and the new kind of
sacred fire. Much the same ritual tale is found in
the Vishnu Purana (iv. 6, 19).</p>

<p>Before attempting to offer our own theory of the
legend, we must examine the explanations presented
by scholars. The philological method of dealing with
myths is well known. The hypothesis is that the
names in a myth are &lsquo;stubborn things,&rsquo; and that, as the
whole narrative has probably arisen from forgetfulness
of the meaning of language, the secret of a myth
must be sought in analysis of the proper names of
the persons. On this principle Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
interprets the myth of Urvasi and Pururavas, their
loves, separation, and reunion. Mr. M&uuml;ller says that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
the story &lsquo;expresses the identity of the morning dawn
and the evening twilight.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> To prove this, the names
are analysed. It is Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s object to show that
though, even in the Veda, Urvasi and Pururavas are
names of persons, they were originally &lsquo;appellations&rsquo;;
and that Urvasi meant &lsquo;dawn,&rsquo; and Pururavas &lsquo;sun.&rsquo;
Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s opinion as to the etymological sense of
the name would be thought decisive, naturally, by lay
readers, if an opposite opinion were not held by that
other great philologist and comparative mythologist,
Adalbert Kuhn. Admitting that &lsquo;the etymology of
Urvasi is difficult,&rsquo; Mr. M&uuml;ller derives it from &lsquo;<i>uru</i>,
wide (<ins class="greek" title="eury">&#949;&#8016;&#961;&#8059;</ins>), and a root <i>as</i> = to pervade.&rsquo; Now the
dawn is &lsquo;widely pervading,&rsquo; and has, in Sanskrit, the
epithet ur&ucirc;k&icirc;, &lsquo;far-going.&rsquo; Mr. M&uuml;ller next assumes
that &lsquo;Eurykyde,&rsquo; &lsquo;Eurynome,&rsquo; &lsquo;Eurydike,&rsquo; and other
heroic Greek female names, are &lsquo;names of the dawn&rsquo;;
but this, it must be said, is merely an assumption of
his school. The main point of the argument is that
Urvasi means &lsquo;far-going,&rsquo; and that &lsquo;the far and wide
splendour of dawn&rsquo; is often spoken of in the Veda.
&lsquo;However, the best proof that Urvasi was the dawn is
the legend told of her and of her love to Pururavas,
a story that is true only of the sun and the dawn&rsquo;
(i. 407).</p>

<p>We shall presently see that a similar story is
told of persons in whom the dawn can scarcely be
recognised, so that &lsquo;the best proof&rsquo; is not very good.</p>

<p>The name of Pururavas, again, is &lsquo;an appropriate
name for a solar hero.&rsquo; ... Pururavas meant the
same as <ins class="greek" title="Polydeuk&ecirc;s">&#928;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#948;&#949;&#8059;&#954;&#951;&#962;</ins>, &lsquo;endowed with much light,&rsquo; for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
though <i>rava</i> is generally used of sound, yet the root
<i>ru</i>, which means originally &lsquo;to cry,&rsquo; is also applied to
colour, in the sense of a loud or crying colour, that
is, red.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> It is interesting to learn that our Aryan
fathers spoke of &lsquo;loud colours,&rsquo; and were so sensitive
as to think violet &lsquo;loud.&rsquo; Besides, Pururavas
calls himself Vasistha, which, as we know, is a name
of the sun; and if he is called Aido, the son of Ida,
the same name is elsewhere given<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> to Agni, the fire.
&lsquo;The conclusion of the argument is that antiquity
spoke of the naked sun, and of the chaste dawn
hiding her face when she had seen her husband. Yet
she says she will come again. And after the sun has
travelled through the world in search of his beloved,
when he comes to the threshold of Death and is going
to end his solitary life, she appears again, in the
gloaming, the same as the dawn, as Eos in Homer,
begins and ends the day, and she carries him away to
the golden seats of the Immortals.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Kuhn objects to all this explanation, partly on
what we think the inadequate ground that there is
no necessary connection between the story of Urvasi
(thus interpreted) and the ritual of sacred fire-lighting.
Connections of that sort were easily invented
at random by the compilers of the Brahmanas
in their existing form. Coming to the analysis of
names, Kuhn finds in Urvasi &lsquo;a weakening of
Urvank&icirc; (<i>uru</i> + <i>anc</i>), like <i>yuva&ccedil;a</i> from <i>yuvanka</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
Latin <i>juvencus</i>; ... the accent is of no decisive
weight.&rsquo; Kuhn will not be convinced that Pururavas is
the sun, and is unmoved by the ingenious theory of &lsquo;a
crying colour,&rsquo; denoted by his name, and the inference,
supported by such words as <i>rufus</i>, that crying colours
are red, and therefore appropriate names of the red
sun. The connection between Pururavas and Agni,
fire, is what appeals to Kuhn&mdash;and, in short, where
Mr. M&uuml;ller sees a myth of sun and dawn, Kuhn
recognises a fire-myth. Roth, again (whose own
name means <em>red</em>), far from thinking that Urvasi is
&lsquo;the chaste dawn,&rsquo; interprets her name as <i>die geile</i>,
that is, &lsquo;lecherous, lascivious, lewd, wanton, obscene&rsquo;;
while Pururavas, as &lsquo;the Roarer,&rsquo; suggests &lsquo;the Bull
in rut.&rsquo; In accordance with these views Roth
explains the myth in a fashion of his own.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, as Kuhn says, &lsquo;we have three
essentially different modes of interpreting the myth,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
all three founded on philological analysis of the names
in the story. No better example could be given to
illustrate the weakness of the philological method.
In the first place, that method relies on names as the
primitive relics and germs of the tale, although the
tale may occur where the names have never been
heard, and though the names are, presumably, late
additions to a story in which the characters were
originally anonymous. Again, the most illustrious
etymologists differ absolutely about the true sense
of the names. Kuhn is disposed to see fire everywhere,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
and fire-myths; Mr. M&uuml;ller to see dawn and
dawn-myths; Schwartz to see storm and storm-myths,
and so on. As the orthodox teachers are
thus at variance, so that there is no safety in orthodoxy,
we may attempt to use our heterodox method.</p>

<p>None of the three scholars whose views we have
glanced at&mdash;neither Roth, Kuhn, nor Mr. M&uuml;ller&mdash;lays
stress on the saying of Urvasi, &lsquo;never let me see you
without your royal garments, <em>for this is the custom of
women</em>.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> To our mind, these words contain the gist
of the myth. There must have been, at some time, a
custom which forbade women to see their husbands
without their garments, or the words have no meaning.
If any custom of this kind existed, a story
might well be evolved to give a sanction to the law.
&lsquo;You must never see your husband naked: think
what happened to Urvasi&mdash;she vanished clean away!&rsquo;
This is the kind of warning which might be given.
If the customary prohibition had grown obsolete,
the punishment might well be assigned to a being
of another, a spiritual race, in which old human ideas
lingered, as the neolithic dread of iron lingers in the
Welsh fairies.</p>

<p>Our method will be, to prove the existence of
singular rules of etiquette, corresponding to the
etiquette accidentally infringed by Pururavas. We
shall then investigate stories of the same character as
that of Urvasi and Pururavas, in which the infringement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
of the etiquette is chastised. It will be seen
that, in most cases, the bride is of a peculiar and perhaps
supernatural race. Finally, the tale of Urvasi
will be taken up again, will be shown to conform in
character to the other stories examined, and will be
explained as a myth told to illustrate, or sanction,
a nuptial etiquette.</p>

<p>The lives of savages are bound by the most
closely-woven fetters of custom. The simplest acts
are &lsquo;tabooed,&rsquo; a strict code regulates all intercourse.
Married life, especially, moves in the strangest fetters.
There will be nothing remarkable in the wide distribution
of the myth turning on nuptial etiquette, if
this law of nuptial etiquette proves to be also widely
distributed. That it is widely distributed we now
propose to demonstrate by examples.</p>

<p>The custom of the African people of the kingdom
of Futa is, or was, even stricter than the Vedic <em>custom
of women</em>&mdash;&lsquo;wives never permit their husbands to see
them unveiled for three years after their marriage.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>In his <i>Travels to Timbuctoo</i> (i. 94), Cailli&eacute; says
that the bridegroom &lsquo;is not allowed to see his
intended during the day.&rsquo; He has a tabooed hut
apart, and &lsquo;if he is obliged to come out he covers his
face.&rsquo; He &lsquo;remains with his wife only till daybreak&rsquo;&mdash;like
Cupid&mdash;and flees, like Cupid, before the light.
Among the Australians the chief deity, if deity such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
a being can be called, Pundjel, &lsquo;has a wife whose face
he has never seen,&rsquo; probably in compliance with some
prim&aelig;val etiquette or taboo.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Among the Yorubas &lsquo;conventional modesty forbids
a woman to speak to her husband, or even to
see him, if it can be avoided.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Of the Iroquois
Lafitau says: &lsquo;Ils n&rsquo;oscent aller dans les cabanes particuli&egrave;res
o&ugrave; habitent leurs &eacute;pouses que durant
l&rsquo;obscurit&eacute; de la nuit.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The Circassian women live
on distant terms with their lords till they become
mothers.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Similar examples of reserve are reported
to be customary among the Fijians.</p>

<p>In backward parts of Europe a strange custom
forbids the bride to speak to her lord, as if in
memory of a time when husband and wife were
always of alien tribes, and, as among the Caribs,
spoke different languages.</p>

<p>In the Bulgarian &lsquo;Volkslied,&rsquo; the Sun marries
Grozdanka, a mortal girl. Her mother addresses her
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Grozdanka, mother&rsquo;s treasure mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For nine long years I nourished thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For nine months see thou do not speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thy first love that marries thee.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>M. Dozon, who has collected the Bulgarian songs,
says that this custom of prolonged silence on the part
of the bride is very common in Bulgaria, though it is
beginning to yield to a sense of the ludicrous.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> In
Sparta and in Crete, as is well known, the bridegroom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
was long the victim of a somewhat similar taboo, and
was only permitted to seek the company of his wife
secretly, and in the dark, like the Iroquois described
by Lafitau.</p>

<p>Herodotus tells us (i. 146) that some of the old
Ionian colonists &lsquo;brought no women with them, but
took wives of the women of the Carians, whose
fathers they had slain. Therefore the women made
a law for themselves, and handed it down to their
daughters, that they should never sit at meat with
their husbands, and <em>that none should ever call her
husband by his name</em>.&rsquo; In precisely the same way, in
Zululand the wife may not mention her husband&rsquo;s
name, just as in the Welsh fairy tale the husband
may not even know the name of his fairy bride, on
pain of losing her for ever. These ideas about names,
and freakish ways of avoiding the use of names, mark
the childhood of languages, according to Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and, therefore, the childhood of Society.
The Kaffirs call this etiquette &lsquo;Hlonipa.&rsquo; It applies
to women as well as men. A Kaffir bride is not
called by her own name in her husband&rsquo;s village,
but is spoken of as &lsquo;mother of so and so,&rsquo; even before
she has born a child. The universal superstition
about names is at the bottom of this custom. The
Aleutian Islanders, according to Dall, are quite distressed
when obliged to speak to their wives in the
presence of others. The Fijians did not know where
to look when missionaries hinted that a man might
live under the same roof as his wife.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
Turkomans, for six months, a year, or two years, a
husband is only allowed to visit his wife by stealth.</p>

<p>The number of these instances could probably be
increased by a little research. Our argument is that
the widely distributed myths in which a husband or
a wife transgresses some &lsquo;custom&rsquo;&mdash;sees the other&rsquo;s
face or body, or utters the forbidden name&mdash;might
well have arisen as tales illustrating the punishment
of breaking the rule. By a very curious coincidence,
a Breton sailor&rsquo;s tale of the &lsquo;Cupid and Psyche&rsquo;
class is confessedly founded on the existence of the
rule of nuptial etiquette.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>In this story the son of a Boulogne pilot marries
the daughter of the King of Naz&mdash;wherever that may
be. In Naz a man is never allowed to see the face
of his wife till she has born him a child&mdash;a modification
of the Futa rule. The inquisitive French
husband unveils his wife, and, like Psyche in Apuleius,
drops wax from a candle on her cheek. When
the pair return to Naz, the king of that country
discovers the offence of the husband, and, by the aid
of his magicians, transforms the Frenchman into a
monster. Here we have the old formula&mdash;the infringement
of a &lsquo;taboo,&rsquo; and the magical punishment&mdash;adapted
to the ideas of Breton peasantry. The
essential point of the story, for our purpose, is that
the veiling of the bride is &lsquo;the custom of women,&rsquo; in
the mysterious land of Naz. &lsquo;C&rsquo;est l&rsquo;usage du pays:
les maris ne voient leurs femmes sans voile que
lorsqu&rsquo;elles sont devenues m&egrave;res.&rsquo; Now our theory
of the myth of Urvasi is simply this: &lsquo;the custom of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
women,&rsquo; which Pururavas transgresses, is probably a
traditional Aryan law of nuptial etiquette, <i>l&rsquo;usage du
pays</i>, once prevalent among the people of India.</p>

<p>If our view be correct, then several rules of
etiquette, and not one alone, will be illustrated in the
stories which we suppose the rules to have suggested.
In the case of Urvasi and Pururavas, the rule was,
not to see the husband naked. In &lsquo;Cupid and
Psyche,&rsquo; the husband was not to be looked upon at
all. In the well-known myth of M&eacute;lusine, the bride
is not to be seen naked. M&eacute;lusine tells her lover that
she will only abide with him <i>dum ipsam nudam non
viderit</i>.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The same taboo occurs in a Dutch <i>M&auml;rchen</i>.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>We have now to examine a singular form of the
myth, in which the strange bride is not a fairy, or
spiritual being, but an animal. In this class of story
the husband is usually forbidden to perform some act
which will recall to the bride the associations of her
old animal existence. The converse of the tale is the
well-known legend of the Forsaken Merman. The
king of the sea permits his human wife to go to
church. The ancient sacred associations are revived,
and the woman returns no more.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She will not come though you call all day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come away, come away.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, in the tales of the animal bride, it is her
associations with her former life among the beasts
that are not to be revived, and when they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
re-awakened by the commission of some act which she
has forbidden, or the neglect of some precaution
which she has enjoined, she, like Urvasi, disappears.</p>


<p class="hrpad">The best known example of this variant of the
tale is the story of Bheki, in Sanskrit. Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller has interpreted the myth in accordance with
his own method.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> His difficulty is to account for
the belief that a king might marry a frog. Our
ancestors, he remarks, &lsquo;were not idiots,&rsquo; how then
could they tell such a story? We might reply that
our ancestors, if we go far enough back, were savages,
and that such stories are the staple of savage myth.
Mr. M&uuml;ller, however, holds that an accidental corruption
of language reduced Aryan fancy to the savage
level. He explains the corruption thus: &lsquo;We find,
in Sanskrit, that Bheki, the frog, was a beautiful girl,
and that one day, when sitting near a well, she was
discovered by a king, who asked her to be his wife.
She consented, <em>on condition that he should never show
her a drop of water</em>. One day, being tired, she asked
the king for water; the king forgot his promise,
brought water, and Bheki disappeared.&rsquo; This myth,
Mr. M&uuml;ller holds, &lsquo;began with a short saying, such
as that &ldquo;Bheki, the sun, will die at the sight of
water,&rdquo; as we should say that the sun will set, when
it approaches the water from which it rose in the
morning.&rsquo; But how did the sun come to be called
Bheki, &lsquo;the frog&rsquo;? Mr. M&uuml;ller supposes that this
name was given to the sun by some poet or fisherman.
He gives no evidence for the following statement:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
&lsquo;It can be shown that &ldquo;frog&rdquo; was used as a name for
the sun. Now at sunrise and sunset, when the sun
was squatting on the water, it was called the &ldquo;frog.&rdquo;&rsquo;
At what historical period the Sanskrit-speaking race
was settled in seats where the sun rose and set in
water, we do not know, and &lsquo;chapter and verse&rsquo; are
needed for the statement that &lsquo;frog&rsquo; was actually a
name of the sun. Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s argument, however,
is that the sun was called &lsquo;the frog,&rsquo; that people forgot
that the frog and sun were identical, and that Frog, or
Bheki, was mistaken for the name of a girl to whom
was applied the old saw about dying at sight of
water. &lsquo;And so,&rsquo; says Mr. M&uuml;ller, &lsquo;the change from
sun to frog, and from frog to man, which was at
first due to the mere spell of language, would in our
nursery tales be ascribed to miraculous charms more
familiar to a later age.&rsquo; As a matter of fact, magical
metamorphoses are infinitely more familiar to the
lowest savages than to people in a &lsquo;later age.&rsquo; Magic,
as Castren observes, &lsquo;belongs to the lowest known
stages of civilisation.&rsquo; Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s theory, however,
is this&mdash;that a Sanskrit-speaking people, living
where the sun rose out of and set in some ocean,
called the sun, as he touched the water, Bheki, the
frog, and said he would die at the sight of water.
They ceased to call the sun the frog, or Bheki, but
kept the saying, &lsquo;Bheki will die at sight of water.&rsquo;
Not knowing who or what Bheki might be, they took
her for a frog, who also was a pretty wench. Lastly,
they made the story of Bheki&rsquo;s distinguished wedding
and mysterious disappearance. For this interpretation,
historical and linguistic evidence is not offered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
When did a Sanskrit-speaking race live beside a
great sea? How do we know that &lsquo;frog&rsquo; was used
as a name for &lsquo;sun&rsquo;?</p>


<p class="hrpad">We have already given our explanation. To the
savage intellect, man and beast are on a level, and all
savage myth makes men descended from beasts; while
stories of the loves of gods in bestial shape, or the
unions of men and animals, incessantly occur. &lsquo;Unnatural&rsquo;
as these notions seem to us, no ideas are
more familiar to savages, and none recur more frequently
in Indo-Aryan, Scandinavian, and Greek
mythology. An extant tribe in North-West America
still claims descent from a frog. The wedding of
Bheki and the king is a survival, in Sanskrit, of a
tale of this kind. Lastly, Bheki disappears, when
her associations with her old amphibious life are revived
in the manner she had expressly forbidden.</p>


<p class="hrpad">Our interpretation may be supported by an Ojibway
parallel. A hunter named Otter-heart, camping
near a beaver lodge, found a pretty girl loitering
round his fire. She keeps his wigwam in order, and
&lsquo;lays his blanket near the deerskin she had laid for
herself. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;this is my wife.&rdquo;&rsquo;
She refuses to eat the beavers he has shot, but at
night he hears a noise, &lsquo;<i>krch, krch</i>, as if beavers were
gnawing wood.&rsquo; He sees, by the glimmer of the
fire, his wife nibbling birch twigs. In fact, the good
little wife is a beaver, as the pretty Indian girl was a
frog. The pair lived happily till spring came and
the snow melted and the streams ran full. Then his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
wife implored the hunter to build her a bridge over
every stream and river, that she might cross dry-footed.
&lsquo;For,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;if my feet touch water, this
would at once cause thee great sorrow.&rsquo; The hunter
did as she bade him, but left unbridged one tidy
runnel. The wife stumbled into the water, and, as
soon as her foot was wet, she immediately resumed
her old shape as a beaver, her son became a beaverling,
and the brooklet, changing to a roaring river,
bore them to the lake. Once the hunter saw his wife
again among her beast kin. &lsquo;To thee I sacrificed all,&rsquo;
she said, &lsquo;and I only asked thee to help me dry-footed
over the waters. Thou didst cruelly neglect
this. Now I must remain for ever with my people.&rsquo;</p>


<p class="hrpad">This tale was told to Kohl by &lsquo;an old insignificant
squaw among the Ojibways.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Here we have a
precise parallel to the tale of Bheki, the frog-bride,
and here the reason of the prohibition to touch water
is made perfectly unmistakable. The touch magically
revived the bride&rsquo;s old animal life with the beavers.
Or was the Indian name for beaver (<i>temaks&eacute;</i>) once a
name for the sun?</p>

<p>A curious variant of this widely distributed
<i>M&auml;rchen</i> of the animal bride is found in the mythical
genealogy of the Raja of Chutia Nagpur, a chief
of the Naga, or snake race. It is said that Raja
Janameja prepared a <i>yajnya</i>, or great malevolently
magical incantation, to destroy all the people of the
serpent race. To prevent this annihilation, the supernatural
being, Pundarika Nag, took a human form,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
and became the husband of the beautiful Parvati,
daughter of a Brahman. But Pundarika Nag, being
a serpent by nature, could not divest himself, even
in human shape, of his forked tongue and venomed
breath. And, just as Urvasi could not abide with her
mortal lover, after he transgressed the prohibition
to appear before her naked, so Pundarika Nag was
compelled by fate to leave his bride, if she asked him
any questions about his disagreeable peculiarities.
She did, at last, ask questions, in circumstances which
made Pundarika believe that he was bound to answer
her. Now the curse came upon him, he plunged
into a pool, like the beaver, and vanished. His wife
became the mother of the serpent Rajas of Chutia
Nagpur. Pundarika Nag, in his proper form as a
great hooded snake, guarded his first-born child.
The crest of the house is a hooded snake with human
face.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, we have many examples of the disappearance
of the bride or bridegroom in consequence
of infringement of various mystic rules. Sometimes
the beloved one is seen when he or she should not
be seen. Sometimes, as in a Maori story, the bride
vanishes merely because she is in a bad temper.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Among the Red Men, as in Sanskrit, the taboo on
water is broken, with the usual results. Now for an
example in which the rule against using <em>names</em> is
infringed.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>This formula constantly occurs in the Welsh fairy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
tales published by Professor Rhys.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Thus the heir
of Corwrion fell in love with a fairy: &lsquo;They were
married on the distinct understanding that the husband
was not to know her name, ... and was not
to strike her with iron, on pain of her leaving him at
once.&rsquo; Unluckily the man once tossed her a bridle,
the iron bit touched the wife, and &lsquo;she at once flew
through the air, and plunged headlong into Corwrion
Lake.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A number of tales turning on the same incident
are published in <i>Cymmrodor</i>, v. i. In these we
have either the taboo on the name, or the taboo on
the touch of iron. In a widely diffused superstition
iron &lsquo;drives away devils and ghosts,&rsquo; according to
the Scholiast on the eleventh book of the <i>Odyssey</i>,
and the Oriental Djinn also flee from iron.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Just as
water is fatal to the Aryan frog-bride and to the
Red Indian beaver-wife, restoring them to their old
animal forms, so the magic touch of iron breaks love
between the Welshman and his fairy mistress, the
representative of the stone age.</p>

<p>In many tales of fairy-brides, they are won by a
kind of force. The lover in the familiar Welsh and
German <i>M&auml;rchen</i> sees the swan-maidens throw off
their swan plumage and dance naked. He steals the
feather-garb of one of them, and so compels her to
his love. Finally, she leaves him, in anger, or because
he has broken some taboo. Far from being
peculiar to Aryan mythology, this legend occurs, as
Mr. Farrer has shown,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> in Algonquin and Bornoese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
tradition. The Red Indian story told by Schoolcraft
in his <i>Algic Researches</i> is most like the Aryan
version, but has some native peculiarities. Wampee
was a great hunter, who, on the lonely prairie, once
heard strains of music. Looking up he saw a speck
in the sky: the speck drew nearer and nearer, and
proved to be a basket containing twelve heavenly
maidens. They reached the earth and began to
dance, inflaming the heart of Wampee with love.
But Wampee could not draw near the fairy girls in
his proper form without alarming them. Like Zeus
in his love adventures, Wampee exercised the medicine-man&rsquo;s
power of metamorphosing himself. He
assumed the form of a mouse, approached unobserved,
and caught one of the dancing maidens. After living
with Wampee for some time she wearied of earth, and,
by virtue of a &lsquo;mystic chain of verse,&rsquo; she ascended
again to her heavenly home.</p>

<p>Now is there any reason to believe that this incident
was once part of the myth of Pururavas and
Urvasi? Was the fairy-love, Urvasi, originally caught
and held by Pururavas among her naked and struggling
companions? Though this does not appear to
have been much noticed, it seems to follow from a
speech of Pururavas in the Vedic dialogue<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> (x. 95, 8, 9).
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller translates thus: &lsquo;When I, the mortal,
threw my arms round those flighty immortals, they
trembled away from me like a trembling doe, like
horses that kick against the cart.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Ludwig&rsquo;s rendering
suits our view&mdash;that Pururavas is telling how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
he first caught Urvasi&mdash;still better: &lsquo;When I, the
mortal, held converse with the immortals who had
laid aside their raiment, like slippery serpents they
glided from me, like horses yoked to the car.&rsquo;
These words would well express the adventure of
a lover among the naked flying swan-maidens, an
adventure familiar to the Red Men as to Persian
legends of the Peris.</p>

<p>To end our comparison of myths like the tale of
&lsquo;Cupid and Psyche,&rsquo; we find an example among the
Zulus. Here<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> the mystic lover came in when all was
dark, and felt the damsel&rsquo;s face. After certain rites,
&lsquo;in the morning he went away, he speaking continually,
the girl not seeing him. During all those days
he would not allow the girl (<i>sic</i>), when she said she
would light a fire. Finally, after a magical ceremony,
he said, &ldquo;Light the fire!&rdquo; and stood before
her revealed, a shining shape.&rsquo; This has a curious
resemblance to the myth of Cupid and Psyche; but
a more curious detail remains. In the Zulu story of
Ukcombekcansini, the friends of a bride break a
taboo and kill a tabooed animal. Instantly, like
Urvasi and her companions in the Yajur Veda, the
bride and her maidens disappear <em>and are turned into
birds</em>!<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> They are afterwards surprised in human
shape, and the bride is restored to her lover.</p>

<p>Here we conclude, having traced parallels to
Cupid and Psyche in many non-Aryan lands. Our
theory of the myth does not rest on etymology.
We have seen that the most renowned scholars,
Max M&uuml;ller, Kuhn, Roth, all analyse the names
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
Urvasi and Pururavas in different ways, and extract
different interpretations. We have found the story
where these names were probably never heard of.
We interpret it as a tale of the intercourse between
mortal men and immortal maids, or between men
and metamorphosed animals, as in India and North
America. We explain the separation of the lovers
as the result of breaking a taboo, or law of etiquette,
binding among men and women, as well as between
men and fairies.</p>


<p class="hrpad">The taboos are, to see the beloved unveiled, to
utter his or her name, to touch her with a metal
&lsquo;terrible to ghosts and spirits,&rsquo; or to do some action
which will revive the associations of a former life.
We have shown that rules of nuptial etiquette
resembling these in character do exist, and have
existed, even among Greeks&mdash;as where the Milesian,
like the Zulu, women made a law not to utter their
husbands&rsquo; names. Finally, we think it a reasonable
hypothesis that tales on the pattern of &lsquo;Cupid and
Psyche&rsquo; might have been evolved wherever a curious
nuptial taboo required to be sanctioned, or explained,
by a myth. On this hypothesis, the stories may have
been separately invented in different lands; but there
is also a chance that they have been transmitted from
people to people in the unknown past of our scattered
and wandering race. This theory seems at least as
probable as the hypothesis that the meaning of an
Aryan proverbial statement about sun and dawn was
forgotten, and was altered unconsciously into a tale
which is found among various non-Aryan tribes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
That hypothesis again, learned and ingenious as it is,
has the misfortune to be opposed by other scholarly
hypotheses not less ingenious and learned.</p>


<p class="hrpad">As for the sun-frog, we may hope that he has
sunk for ever beneath the western wave.</p>

introduced late to account for a prohibition of which the real meaning
had been forgotten. The improbability of this view is indicated by
the frequency of similar prohibitions in actual custom.</p>

<h2><a name="chap05" id="chap05"></a><i>A FAR-TRAVELLED TALE.</i></h2>


<p>A modern novelist has boasted that her books
are read &lsquo;from Tobolsk to Tangiers.&rsquo; This is a wide
circulation, but the widest circulation in the world
has probably been achieved by a story whose author,
unlike Ouida, will never be known to fame. The
tale which we are about to examine is, perhaps, of
all myths the most widely diffused, yet there is no
ready way of accounting for its extraordinary popularity.
Any true &lsquo;nature-myth,&rsquo; any myth which
accounts for the processes of nature or the aspects of
natural phenomena, may conceivably have been invented
separately, wherever men in an early state of
thought observed the same facts, and attempted to
explain them by telling a story. Thus we have seen
that the earlier part of the myth of Cronus is a
nature-myth, setting forth the cause of the separation
of Heaven and Earth. Star-myths, again, are everywhere
similar, because men who believed all nature
to be animated and personal, accounted for the grouping
of constellations in accordance with these crude
beliefs.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Once more, if a story like that of &lsquo;Cupid and
Psyche&rsquo; be found among the most diverse races, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
distribution becomes intelligible if the myth was invented
to illustrate or enforce a widely prevalent
custom. But in the following story no such explanation
is even provisionally acceptable.</p>

<p>The gist of the tale (which has many different
&lsquo;openings,&rsquo; and conclusions in different places) may be
stated thus: A young man is brought to the home of
a hostile animal, a giant, cannibal, wizard, or a malevolent
king. He is put by his unfriendly host to various
severe trials, in which it is hoped that he will perish.
In each trial he is assisted by the daughter of his
host. After achieving the adventures, he elopes with
the girl, and is pursued by her father. The runaway
pair throw various common objects behind them,
which are changed into magical obstacles and check
the pursuit of the father. The myth has various
endings, usually happy, in various places. Another
form of the narrative is known, in which the visitors
to the home of the hostile being are, not wooers of his
daughter, but brothers of his wife.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The incidents of
the flight, in this variant, are still of the same character.
Finally, when the flight is that of a brother from his
sister&rsquo;s malevolent ghost, in Hades (Japan), or of two
sisters from a cannibal mother or step-mother (Zulu
and Samoyed), the events of the flight and the magical
aids to escape remain little altered. We shall afterwards
see that attempts have been made to interpret
one of these narratives as a nature-myth; but the
attempts seem unsuccessful. We are therefore at a
loss to account for the wide diffusion of this tale,
unless it has been transmitted slowly from people to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
people, in the immense unknown prehistoric past of
the human race.</p>


<p class="hrpad">Before comparing the various forms of the myth
in its first shape&mdash;that which tells of the mortal lover
and the giant&rsquo;s or wizard&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;let us give
the Scottish version of the story. This version was
written down for me, many years ago, by an aged
lady in Morayshire. I published it in the <i>Revue
Celtique</i>; but it is probably new to story-comparers,
in its broad Scotch variant.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Nicht Nought Nothing.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>There once lived a king and a queen. They were long
married and had no bairns: but at last the queen had a bairn,
when the king was away in far countries. The queen would
not christen the bairn till the king came back, and she said,
&lsquo;We will just call him <em>Nicht Nought Nothing</em> until his father
comes home.&rsquo; But it was long before he came home, and
the boy had grown a nice little laddie. At length the king
was on his way back; but he had a big river to cross, and
there was a spate, and he could not get over the water.
But a giant came up to him, and said, &lsquo;If you will give me
Nicht Nought Nothing, I will carry you over the water on
my back.&rsquo; The king had never heard that his son was called
Nicht Nought Nothing, and so he promised him. When
the king got home again, he was very happy to see his wife
again, and his young son. She told him that she had not
given the child any name but Nicht Nought Nothing,
until he should come home again himself. The poor king
was in a terrible case. He said, &lsquo;What have I done? I
promised to give the giant who carried me over the river on
his back, Nicht Nought Nothing.&rsquo; The king and the queen
were sad and sorry, but they said, &lsquo;When the giant comes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
we will give him the hen-wife&rsquo;s bairn; he will never know
the difference.&rsquo; The next day the giant came to claim the
king&rsquo;s promise, and he sent for the hen-wife&rsquo;s bairn; and
the giant went away with the bairn on his back. He
travelled till he came to a big stone, and there he sat down
to rest. He said,</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hidge Hodge, on my back, what time of day is it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The poor little bairn said, &lsquo;It is the time that my mother,
the hen-wife, takes up the eggs for the queen&rsquo;s breakfast.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The giant was very angry, and dashed the bairn on the
stone and killed it.</p>


<p class="hrpad">The same adventure is repeated with the gardener&rsquo;s son.</p>


<p class="hrpad">Then the giant went back to the king&rsquo;s house, and said
he would destroy them all if they did not give him Nicht
Nought Nothing this time. They had to do it; and when
he came to the big stone, the giant said, &lsquo;What time of day
is it?&rsquo; Nicht Nought Nothing said, &lsquo;It is the time that my
father the king will be sitting down to supper.&rsquo; The giant
said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got the right ane noo;&rsquo; and took Nicht Nought
Nothing to his own house and brought him up till he was
a man.</p>

<p>The giant had a bonny dochter, and she and the lad
grew very fond of each other. The giant said one day to
Nicht Nought Nothing, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve work for you to-morrow.
There is a stable seven miles long and seven miles broad,
and it has not been cleaned for seven years, and you must
clean it to-morrow, or I will have you for my supper.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The giant&rsquo;s dochter went out next morning with the lad&rsquo;s
breakfast, and found him in a terrible state, for aye as he
cleaned out a bit, it aye fell in again. The giant&rsquo;s dochter
said she would help him, and she cried a&rsquo; the beasts o&rsquo; the
field, and a&rsquo; the fowls o&rsquo; the air, and in a minute they a&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
came, and carried awa&rsquo; everything that was in the stable
and made a&rsquo; clean before the giant came home. He said,
&lsquo;Shame for the wit that helped you; but I have a worse job
for you to-morrow.&rsquo; Then he told Nicht Nought Nothing
that there was a loch seven miles long, and seven miles
deep, and seven miles broad, and he must drain it the next
day, or else he would have him for his supper. Nicht
Nought Nothing began early next morning and tried to
lave the water with his pail, but the loch was never getting
any less, and he did no ken what to do; but the giant&rsquo;s
dochter called on all the fish in the sea to come and drink
the water, and very soon they drank it dry. When the
giant saw the work done he was in a rage, and said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a
worse job for you to-morrow; there is a tree seven miles
high, and no branch on it, till you get to the top, and there
is a nest, and you must bring down the eggs without breaking
one, or else I will have you for my supper.&rsquo; At first the
giant&rsquo;s dochter did not know how to help Nicht Nought
Nothing; but she cut off first her fingers and then her toes,
and made steps of them, and he clamb the tree, and got all
the eggs safe till he came to the bottom, and then one was
broken. The giant&rsquo;s dochter advised him to run away,
and she would follow him. So he travelled until he came to
a king&rsquo;s palace, and the king and queen took him in and
were very kind to him. The giant&rsquo;s dochter left her father&rsquo;s
house, and he pursued her and was drowned. Then she
came to the king&rsquo;s palace where Nicht Nought Nothing
was. And she went up into a tree to watch for him. The
gardener&rsquo;s dochter, going to draw water in the well, saw
the shadow of the lady in the water, and thought it was
herself, and said, &lsquo;If I&rsquo;m so bonny, if I&rsquo;m so brave, do
you send me to draw water?&rsquo; The gardener&rsquo;s wife went
out, and she said the same thing. Then the gardener went
himself, and brought the lady from the tree, and led her in.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
And he told her that a stranger was to marry the king&rsquo;s
dochter, and showed her the man: and it was Nicht
Nought Nothing asleep in a chair. And she saw him, and
cried to him, &lsquo;Waken, waken, and speak to me!&rsquo; But he
would not waken, and syne she cried,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;I cleaned the stable, I laved the loch, and I clamb the tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And all for the love of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And thou wilt not waken and speak to me.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The king and the queen heard this, and came to the
bonny young lady, and she said,</p>

<p>&lsquo;I canna get Nicht Nought Nothing to speak to me for
all that I can do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then were they greatly astonished when she spoke of
Nicht Nought Nothing, and asked where he was, and she
said, &lsquo;He that sits there in the chair.&rsquo; Then they ran to
him and kissed him and called him their own dear son, and
he wakened, and told them all that the giant&rsquo;s dochter had
done for him, and of all her kindness. Then they took her
in their arms and kissed her, and said she should now be
their dochter, for their son should marry her.</p>

<p>And they lived happy all their days.</p>
</div>

<p>In this variant of the story, which we may use as
our text, it is to be noticed that a <i>lacuna</i> exists. The
narrative of the flight omits to mention that the
runaways threw things behind them which became
obstacles in the giant&rsquo;s way. One of these objects
probably turned into a lake, in which the giant was
drowned.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> A common incident is the throwing
behind of a comb, which changes into a thicket.
The formula of leaving obstacles behind occurs in the
Indian collection, the &lsquo;Kathasarit sagara&rsquo; (vii. xxxix.).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
&lsquo;The Battle of the Birds,&rsquo; in Campbell&rsquo;s <i>Tales of the
West Highlands</i>, is a very copious Gaelic variant.
Russian parallels are &lsquo;Vasilissa the Wise and the
Water King,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The King Bear.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The incident
of the flight and the magical obstacles is found in
Japanese mythology.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The &lsquo;ugly woman of Hades&rsquo;
is sent to pursue the hero. He casts down his black
head-dress, and it is instantly turned into grapes; he
fled while she was eating them. Again, &lsquo;he cast down
his multitudinous and close-toothed comb, and it
instantly turned into bamboo sprouts.&rsquo; In the Gaelic
version, the pursuer is detained by talkative objects
which the pursued leave at home, and this marvel
recurs in Zululand, and is found among the Bushmen.
The Zulu versions are numerous.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Oddly enough, in
the last variant, the girl performs no magic feat, but
merely throws sesamum on the ground to delay the
cannibals, for cannibals are very fond of sesamum.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>


<p class="hrpad">Here, then, we have the remarkable details of the
flight, in Zulu, Gaelic, Norse, Malagasy,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Russian,
Italian, Japanese. Of all incidents in the myth,
the incidents of the flight are most widely known.
But the whole connected series of events&mdash;the coming
of the wooer; the love of the hostile being&rsquo;s daughter;
the tasks imposed on the wooer; the aid rendered
by the daughter; the flight of the pair; the defeat or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
destruction of the hostile being&mdash;all these, or most of
these, are extant, in due sequence, among the following
races. The Greeks have the tale, the people of
Madagascar have it, the Lowland Scotch, the Celts, the
Russians, the Italians, the Algonquins, the Finns, and
the Samoans have it. Now if the story were confined
to the Aryan race, we might account for its diffusion,
by supposing it to be the common heritage of the
Indo-European peoples, carried everywhere with them
in their wanderings. But when the tale is found in
Madagascar, North America, Samoa, and among the
Finns, while many scattered incidents occur in even
more widely severed races, such as Zulus, Bushmen,
Japanese, Eskimo, Samoyeds, the Aryan hypothesis
becomes inadequate.</p>

<p>To show how closely, all things considered, the
Aryan and non-Aryan possessors of the tale agree,
let us first examine the myth of Jason.</p>


<p class="hrpad">The earliest literary reference to the myth of
Jason is in the <i>Iliad</i> (vii. 467, xxiii. 747). Here we
read of Euneos, a son whom Hypsipyle bore to Jason
in Lemnos. Already, even in the <i>Iliad</i>, the legend
of Argo&rsquo;s voyage has been fitted into certain well-known
geographical localities. A reference in the
<i>Odyssey</i> (xii. 72) has a more antique ring: we are
told that of all barques Argo alone escaped the jaws
of the Rocks Wandering, which clashed together and
destroyed ships. Argo escaped, it is said, &lsquo;because
Jason was dear to Hera.&rsquo; It is plain, from various
fragmentary notices, that Hesiod was familiar with
several of the adventures in the legend of Jason.

In the <i>Theogony</i> (993-998) Hesiod mentions the
essential facts of the legend: how Jason carried off
from &AElig;etes his daughter, &lsquo;after achieving the adventures,
many and grievous, which were laid upon him.&rsquo;
At what period the home of &AElig;etes was placed in
Colchis, it is not easy to determine. Mimnermus, a
contemporary of Solon, makes the home of &AElig;etes lie
&lsquo;on the brink of ocean,&rsquo; a very vague description.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
Pindar, on the other hand, in the splendid Fourth
Pythian Ode, already knows Colchis as the scene of
the loves and flight of Jason and Medea.</p>


<p class="hrpad">&lsquo;Long were it for me to go by the beaten track,&rsquo;
says Pindar, &lsquo;and I know a certain short path.&rsquo; Like
Pindar, we may abridge the tale of Jason. He seeks
the golden fleece in Colchis: &AElig;etes offers it to him as
a prize for success in certain labours. By the aid of
Medea, the daughter of &AElig;etes, the wizard king, Jason
tames the fire-breathing oxen, yokes them to the
plough, and drives a furrow. By Medea&rsquo;s help he
conquers the children of the teeth of the dragon,
subdues the snake that guards the fleece of gold, and
escapes, but is pursued by &AElig;etes. To detain &AElig;etes,
Medea throws behind the mangled remains of her own
brother, Apsyrtos, and the Colchians pursue no further
than the scene of this bloody deed. The savagery as
this act survives even in the work of a poet so late as
Apollonius Rhodius (iv. 477), where we read how
Jason performed a rite of savage magic, mutilating
the body of Apsyrtos in a manner which was believed
to appease the avenging ghost of the slain. &lsquo;Thrice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
he tasted the blood, thrice spat it out between his teeth,&rsquo;
a passage which the Scholiast says contains the description
of an archaic custom popular among murderers.</p>

<p>Beyond Tomi, where a popular etymology fixed
the &lsquo;cutting up&rsquo; of Apsyrtos, we need not follow the
fortunes of Jason and Medea. We have already seen
the wooer come to the hostile being, win his daughter&rsquo;s
love, achieve the adventures by her aid, and flee in
her company, delaying, by a horrible device, the
advance of her pursuers. To these incidents in the
tale we confine our attention.</p>

<p>Many explanations of the Jason myth have been
given by Scholars who thought they recognised elemental
phenomena in the characters. As usual these
explanations differ widely. Whenever a myth has to
be interpreted, it is certain that one set of Scholars
will discover the sun and the dawn, where another
set will see the thunder-cloud and lightning. The
moon is thrown in at pleasure.</p>

<p>Preller<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> is a learned Scholar, with his own set of
etymologies. Jason is derived, he thinks, from <ins class="greek" title="iaomai">&#7984;&#8049;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</ins>,
to heal, because Jason studied medicine under the
Centaur Chiron. This is the view of the Scholiast
on Apollonius Rhodius (i. 554). Jason, to Preller&rsquo;s
mind, is a form of Asclepius, &lsquo;a spirit of the spring
with its soft suns and fertile rains.&rsquo; Medea is the
moon. Medea, on the other hand, is a lightning
goddess, in the opinion of Schwartz.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> No philological
reason is offered. Mr. Brown writes: &lsquo;The moon, as
the night-light, linked with Idyia-Daeira, is itself
knowing, and so appears as M&ecirc;deia (&ldquo;the Wise&rdquo;).&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
We must suppose, it seems, that either the soft
spring rains and the moon, or the dawn and the
sun, or the lightning and the thunder-cloud, in one
arrangement or another, irresistibly suggested, to
early Aryan minds, the picture of a wooer, arriving
in a hostile home, winning a maiden&rsquo;s love, achieving
adventures by her aid, fleeing with her from her angry
father and delaying his pursuit by various devices.
Why the spring, the moon, the lightning, the dawn&mdash;any
of them or all of them&mdash;should have suggested
such a tale, let Scholars determine when they have
reconciled their own differences. It is more to
our purpose to follow the myth among Samoans,
Algonquins, and Finns. None of these races speak
an Aryan language, and none can have been beguiled
into telling the same sort of tale by a disease of Aryan
speech.</p>

<p>Samoa, where we find our story, is the name of a
group of volcanic islands in Central Polynesia. They
are about 3000 miles from Sydney, were first observed
by Europeans in 1722, and are as far removed as
most spots from direct Aryan influences. Our position
is, however, that in the shiftings and migrations
of peoples, the Jason tale has somehow been swept,
like a piece of drift-wood, on to the coasts of Samoa.
In the islands, the tale has an epical form, and is
chanted in a poem of twenty-six stanzas. There is
something Greek, in the free and happy life of the
Samoans&mdash;something Greek, too, in this myth of theirs.
There was once a youth, Siati, famous for his singing,
a young Thamyris of Samoa. But as, according
to Homer, &lsquo;the Muses met Thamyris the Thracian,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
and made an end of his singing, for he boasted and
said that he would vanquish even the Muses if he
sang against them,&rsquo; so did the Samoan god of song
envy Siati. The god and the mortal sang a match:
the daughter of the god was to be the mortal&rsquo;s prize
if he proved victorious. Siati won, and he set off,
riding on a shark, as Arion rode the dolphin, to
seek the home of the defeated deity. At length he
reached the shores divine, and thither strayed Puapae,
daughter of the god, looking for her comb which she
had lost. &lsquo;Siati,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;how camest thou hither?&rsquo;
&lsquo;I am come to seek the song-god, and to wed his
daughter.&rsquo; &lsquo;My father,&rsquo; said the maiden, &lsquo;is more a
god than a man; eat nothing he hands you, never
sit on a high seat, lest death follow.&rsquo; So they were
united in marriage. But the god, like &AElig;etes, was
wroth, and began to set Siati upon perilous tasks:
&lsquo;Build me a house, and let it be finished this very
day, else death and the oven await thee.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Siati wept, but the god&rsquo;s daughter had the house
built by the evening. The other adventures were to
fight a fierce dog, and to find a ring lost at sea.
Just as the Scotch giant&rsquo;s daughter cut off her fingers
to help her lover, so the Samoan god&rsquo;s daughter bade
Siati cut her body into pieces and cast her into the sea.
There she became a fish, and recovered the ring.
They set off to the god&rsquo;s house, but met him pursuing
them, with the help of his other daughter. &lsquo;Puapae
and Siati threw down the comb; and it became a bush
of thorns in the way to intercept the god and Puanli,&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
the other daughter. Next they threw down a bottle of
earth, which became a mountain; &lsquo;and then followed
their bottle of water, and that became a sea, and
drowned the god and Puanli.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>This old Samoan song contains nearly the closest
savage parallel to the various household tales which
find their heroic and artistic shape in the Jason
saga. Still more surprising in its resemblances is
the Malagasy version of the narrative. In the
Malagasy story, the conclusion is almost identical
with the winding up of the Scotch fairy tale. The
girl hides in a tree; her face, seen reflected in a well,
is mistaken by women for their own faces, and the
recognition follows in due course.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Like most Red Indian versions of popular tales,
the Algonquin form of the Jason saga is strongly
marked with the peculiarities of the race. The story
is recognisable, and that is all.</p>

<p>The opening, as usual, differs from other openings.
Two children are deserted in the wilderness, and grow
up to manhood. One of them loses an arrow in the
water; the elder brother, Panigwun, wades after it.
A magical canoe flies past: an old magician, who is
alone in the canoe, seizes Panigwun and carries him
off. The canoe fleets along, like the barques of the
Ph&aelig;acians, at the will of the magician, and reaches
the isle where, like the Samoan god of song, he dwells
with his two daughters. &lsquo;Here, my daughter,&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;is a young man for your husband.&rsquo; But the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
daughter knew that the proposed husband was but
another victim of the old man&rsquo;s magic arts. By the
daughter&rsquo;s advice, Panigwun escaped in the magic
barque, consoled his brother, and returned to the
island. Next day the magician, Mishosha, set the
young man to hard tasks and perilous adventures.
He was to gather gulls&rsquo; eggs; but the gulls attacked
him in dense crowds. By an incantation he subdued
the birds, and made them carry him home to the island.
Next day he was sent to gather pebbles, that he
might be attacked and eaten by the king of the fishes.
Once more the young man, like the Finnish Ilmarinen
in Pohjola, subdued the mighty fish, and went back
triumphant. The third adventure, as in &lsquo;Nicht Nought
Nothing,&rsquo; was to climb a tree of extraordinary height
in search of a bird&rsquo;s nest. Here, again, the youth
succeeded, and finally conspired with the daughters
to slay the old magician. Lastly the boy turned the
magician into a sycamore tree, and won his daughter.
The other daughter was given to the brother who had
no share in the perils.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Here we miss the incident of
the flight;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and the magician&rsquo;s daughter, though in
love with the hero, does not aid him to perform the
feats. Perhaps an Algonquin brave would scorn the
assistance of a girl. In the &lsquo;Kalevala,&rsquo; the old hero,
W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen, and his friend Ilmarinen, set off to the
mysterious and hostile land of Pohjola to win a bride.
The maiden of Pohjola loses her heart to Ilmarinen,
and, by her aid, he bridles the wolf and bear, ploughs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
a field of adders with a plough of gold, and conquers
the gigantic pike that swims in the Styx of Finnish
mythology. After this point the story is interrupted
by a long sequel of popular bridal songs, and, in the
wandering course of the rather aimless epic, the flight
and its incidents have been forgotten, or are neglected.
These incidents recur, however, in the thread of somewhat
different plots. We have seen that they are found
in Japan, among the Eskimo, among the Bushmen, the
Samoyeds, and the Zulus, as well as in Hungarian,
Magyar, Celtic, and other European household tales.</p>

<p>The conclusion appears to be that the central part
of the Jason myth is incapable of being explained,
either as a nature-myth, or as a myth founded on a
disease of language. So many languages could not
take the same malady in the same way; nor can we
imagine any series of natural phenomena that would
inevitably suggest this tale to so many diverse races.
We must suppose, therefore, either that all wits
jumped and invented the same romantic series of
situations by accident, or that all men spread from
one centre, where the story was known, or that the
story, once invented, has drifted all round the world.
If the last theory be approved of, the tale will be like
the Indian Ocean shell found lately in the Polish
bone-cave,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> or like the Egyptian beads discovered in
the soil of Dahomey. The story will have been carried
hither and thither, in the remotest times, to the remotest
shores, by traders, by slaves, by captives in
war, or by women torn from their own tribe and
forcibly settled as wives among alien peoples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
Stories of this kind are everywhere the natural
property of mothers and grandmothers. When we
remember how widely diffused is the law of exogamy,
which forbids marriage between a man and woman of
the same stock, we are impressed by the number of
alien elements which must have been introduced with
alien wives. Where husband and wife, as often happened,
spoke different languages, the woman would
inevitably bring the hearthside tales of her childhood
among a people of strange speech. By all these
agencies, working through dateless time, we may
account for the diffusion, if we cannot explain the
origin, of tales like the central arrangement of incidents
in the career of Jason.</p>

<h2><a name="chap06" id="chap06"></a><i>APOLLO AND THE MOUSE.</i></h2>


<p>Why is Apollo, especially the Apollo of the Troad,
he who showered the darts of pestilence among the
Greeks, so constantly associated with a mouse? The
very name, Smintheus, by which his favourite priest
calls on him in the <i>Iliad</i> (i. 39), might be rendered
&lsquo;Mouse Apollo,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Apollo, Lord of Mice.&rsquo; As we
shall see later, mice lived beneath the altar, and
were fed in the holy of holies of the god, and an
image of a mouse was placed beside or upon his
sacred tripod. The ancients were puzzled by these
things, and, as will be shown, accounted for them by
&lsquo;mouse-stories,&rsquo; <ins class="greek" title="Sminthiakoi logoi">&#931;&#956;&#953;&#957;&#952;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#8054; &#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#953;</ins>, so styled by Eustathius,
the medi&aelig;val interpreter of Homer. Following
our usual method, let us ask whether similar
phenomena occur elsewhere, in countries where they
are intelligible. Did insignificant animals elsewhere
receive worship: were their effigies elsewhere placed
in the temples of a purer creed? We find answers
in the history of Peruvian religion.</p>

<p>After the Spanish conquest of Peru, one of the
European adventurers, Don Garcilasso de la Vega,
married an Inca princess. Their son, also named
Garcilasso, was born about 1540. His famous book,
<i>Commentarias Reales</i>, contains the most authentic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
account of the old Peruvian beliefs. Garcilasso was
learned in all the learning of the Europeans, and,
as an Inca on the mother&rsquo;s side, had claims on the
loyalty of the defeated race. He set himself diligently
to collect both their priestly and popular
traditions, and his account of them is the more trustworthy
as it coincides with what we know to have
been true in lands with which Garcilasso had little
acquaintance.</p>


<p class="hrpad">To Garcilasso&rsquo;s mind, Peruvian religion seems to
be divided into two periods&mdash;the age before, and the
age which followed the accession of the Incas, and
their establishment of sun-worship as the creed of
the State. In the earlier period, the pre-Inca period,
he tells us &lsquo;an Indian was not accounted honourable
unless he was descended from a fountain, river, or lake,
or even from the sea, or from a wild animal, such as
a bear, lion, tiger, eagle, or the bird they call <i>cuntur</i>
(condor), or some other bird of prey.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> To these
worshipful creatures &lsquo;men offered what they usually
saw them eat&rsquo; (i. 53). But men were not content to
adore large and dangerous animals. &lsquo;There was not
an animal, how vile and filthy soever, that they did
not worship as a god,&rsquo; including &lsquo;lizards, toads, and
frogs.&rsquo; In the midst of these superstitions the Incas
appeared. Just as the tribes claimed descent from
animals, great or small, so the Incas drew <em>their</em> pedigree
from the sun, which they adored like the <i>gens</i>
of the Aurelii in Rome.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Thus every Indian had his
<i>pacarissa</i>, or, as the North American Indians say,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
<i>totem</i>,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> a natural object from which he claimed descent,
and which, in a certain degree, he worshipped.
Though sun-worship became the established religion,
worship of the animal <i>pacarissas</i> was still tolerated.
The sun-temples also contained <i>huacas</i>, or images, of
the beasts which the Indians had venerated.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> In the
great temple of Pachacamac, the most spiritual and
abstract god of Peruvian faith, &lsquo;they worshipped a
she-fox and an emerald. The devil also appeared
to them, and spoke in the form of a tiger, very
fierce.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> This toleration of an older and cruder, in
subordination to a purer, faith is a very common
feature in religious evolution. In Catholic countries,
to this day, we may watch, in Holy Week, the Adonis
feast described by Theocritus,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and the procession and
entombment of the old god of spring.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Incas had the good policy to collect all the
tribal animal gods into their temples in and round
Cuzco, in which the two leading gods were the Master
of Life, and the Sun.&rsquo; Did a process of this sort ever
occur in Greek religion, and were older animal gods
ever collected into the temples of such deities as
Apollo?</p>


<p class="hrpad">While a great deal of scattered evidence about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
many animals consecrated to Greek gods points in
this direction, it will be enough, for the present, to
examine the case of the Sacred Mice. Among races
which are still in the totemistic stage, which still
claim descent from animals and from other objects,
a peculiar marriage law generally exists, or can be
shown to have existed. No man may marry a woman
who is descended from the same ancestral animal,
and who bears the same totem-name, and carries
the same badge or family crest, as himself. A man
descended from the Crane, and whose family name is
Crane, cannot marry a woman whose family name
is Crane. He must marry a woman of the Wolf, or
Turtle, or Swan, or other name, and her children
keep her family title, not his. Thus, if a Crane man
marries a Swan woman, the children are Swans, and
none of them may marry a Swan; they must marry
Turtles, Wolves, or what not, and <em>their</em> children,
again, are Turtles, or Wolves. Thus there is necessarily
an eternal come and go of all the animal
names known in a district. As civilisation advances
these rules grow obsolete. People take their names
from the father, as among ourselves. Finally the
dwellers in a given district, having become united
into a local tribe, are apt to drop the various animal
titles and to adopt, as the name of the whole tribe,
the name of the chief, or of the predominating family.
Let us imagine a district of some twenty miles in
which there are Crane, Wolf, Turtle, and Swan
families. Long residence together, and common
interests, have welded them into a local tribe. The
chief is of the Wolf family, and the tribe, sinking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
family differences and family names, calls itself &lsquo;the
Wolves.&rsquo; Such tribes were probably, in the beginning,
the inhabitants of the various Egyptian towns
which severally worshipped the wolf, or the sheep,
or the crocodile, and abstained religiously (except on
certain sacrificial occasions) from the flesh of the
animal that gave them its name.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>


<p class="hrpad">It has taken us long to reach the Sacred Mice
of Greek religion, but we are now in a position to
approach their august divinity. We have seen that
the sun-worship superseded, without abolishing, the
tribal <i>pacarissas</i> in Peru, and that the <i>huacas</i>, or
images, of the sacred animals were admitted under
the roof of the temple of the Sun. Now it is recognised
that the temples of the Sminthian Apollo contained
images of sacred mice among other animals,
and our argument is that here, perhaps, we have
another example of the Peruvian religious evolution.
Just as, in Peru, the tribes adored &lsquo;vile and filthy&rsquo;
animals, just as the solar worship of the Incas subordinated
these, just as the <i>huacas</i> of the beasts
remained in the temples of the Peruvian Sun; so, we
believe, the tribes along the Mediterranean coasts had,
at some very remote prehistoric period, their animal
<i>pacarissas</i>; these were subordinated to the religion
(to some extent solar) of Apollo; and the <i>huacas</i>, or
animal idols, survived in Apollo&rsquo;s temples.</p>


<p class="hrpad">If this theory be correct, we shall probably find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
the mouse, for example, revered as a sacred animal in
many places. This would necessarily follow, if the
marriage customs which we have described ever prevailed
on Greek soil, and scattered the mouse-name
far and wide.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Traces of the Mouse families, and of
adoration, if adoration there was of the mouse, would
linger on in the following shapes: (1) Places would
be named from mice, and mice would be actually held
sacred in themselves. (2) The mouse-name would be
given locally to the god who superseded the mouse.
(3) The figure of the mouse would be associated with
the god, and used as a badge, or a kind of crest, or
local mark, in places where the mouse has been a
venerated animal. (4) Finally, myths would be told
to account for the sacredness of a creature so
undignified.</p>

<p>Let us take these considerations in their order:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) If there were local mice tribes, deriving their
name from the worshipful mouse, certain towns
settled by these tribes would retain a reverence for
mice.</p>

<p>In Chrysa, a town of the Troad, according to
Heraclides Ponticus, mice were held sacred, the local
name for mouse being <ins class="greek" title="sminthos">&#963;&#956;&#8055;&#957;&#952;&#959;&#962;</ins>. Many places bore
this mouse-name, according to Strabo.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> This is
precisely what would have occurred had the Mouse
totem, and the Mouse stock, been widely distributed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
The Scholiast<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> mentions Sminthus as a place in the
Troad. Strabo speaks of two places deriving their
name from Sminthus, or mouse, near the Sminthian
temple, and others near Larissa. In Rhodes and
Lindus, the mouse place-name recurs, &lsquo;and in many
other districts&rsquo; (<ins class="greek" title="Kai allothi de pollachothi">&#922;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8057;&#952;&#953; &#948;&#949; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#967;&#8057;&#952;&#953;</ins>). Strabo
(x. 486) names Caressus, and Poeessa, in Ceos, among
the other places which has Sminthian temples, and,
presumably, were once centres of tribes named after
the mouse.</p>

<p>Here, then, are a number of localities in which
the Mouse Apollo was adored, and where the old
mouse-name lingered. That the mice were actually
held sacred in their proper persons we learn from
&AElig;lian. &lsquo;The dwellers in Hamaxitus of the Troad
worship mice,&rsquo; says &AElig;lian. &lsquo;In the temple of
Apollo Smintheus, mice are nourished, and food is
offered to them at the public expense, and white
mice dwell beneath the altar.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> In the same way we
found that the Peruvians fed their sacred beasts on
what they usually saw them eat.</p>

<p>(2) The second point in our argument has already
been sufficiently demonstrated. The mouse-name
&lsquo;Smintheus&rsquo; was given to Apollo in all the places
mentioned by Strabo, &lsquo;and many others.&rsquo;</p>

<p>(3) The figure of the mouse will be associated
with the god, and used as a badge, or crest, or local
mark, in places where the mouse has been a venerated
animal.</p>

<p>The passage already quoted from &AElig;lian informs
us that there stood &lsquo;an effigy of the mouse beside the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
tripod of Apollo.&rsquo; In Chrysa, according to Strabo
(xiii. 604), the statue of Apollo Smintheus had a
mouse beneath his foot. The mouse on the tripod of
Apollo is represented on a bas-relief illustrating the
plague, and the offerings of the Greeks to Apollo
Smintheus, as described in the first book of the
<i>Iliad</i>.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>


<p class="hrpad">The mouse is not an uncommon local badge or
crest in Greece. The animals whose figures are
stamped on coins, like the Athenian owl, are the
most ancient marks of cities. It is plausible conjecture
that, just as the Iroquois when they signed
treaties with the Europeans used their totems&mdash;bear,
wolf, and turtle&mdash;as seals,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> so the animals on archaic
Greek city coins represented crests or badges which,
at some far more remote period, had been totems.</p>

<p>The Argives, according to Pollux,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> stamped the
mouse on their coins.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> As there was a temple of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
Apollo Smintheus in Tenedos, we naturally hear of
a mouse on the coins of the island.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Golzio has
published one of these mouse coins. The people
of Metapontum stamped their money with a mouse
gnawing an ear of corn. The people of Cum&aelig; employed
a mouse dormant. Paoli fancied that certain
mice on Roman medals might be connected with the
family of <i>Mus</i>, but this is rather guesswork.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>We have now shown traces, at least, of various
ways in which an early tribal religion of the mouse&mdash;the
mouse <i>pacarissa</i>, as the Peruvians said&mdash;may have
been perpetuated. When we consider that the superseding
of the mouse by Apollo must have occurred,
if it did occur, long before Homer, we may rather
wonder that the mouse left his mark on Greek religion
so long. We have seen mice revered, a god with
a mouse-name, the mouse-name recurring in many
places, the <i>huaca</i>, or idol of the mouse, preserved in
the temples of the god, and the mouse-badge used
in several widely severed localities. It remains (4)
to examine the myths about mice. These, in our
opinion, were probably told to account for the
presence of the <i>huaca</i> of the mouse in temples, and
for the occurrence of the animal in religion, and his
connection with Apollo.</p>

<p>A singular mouse-myth, narrated by Herodotus,
is worth examining for reasons which will appear
later, though the events are said to have happened on
Egyptian soil.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> According to Herodotus, one Sethos,
a priest of Heph&aelig;stus (Ptah), was king of Egypt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
He had disgraced the military class, and he found
himself without an army when Sennacherib invaded
his country. Sethos fell asleep in the temple, and
the god, appearing to him in a vision, told him that
divine succour would come to the Egyptians.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> In
the night before the battle, field-mice gnawed the
quivers and shield-handles of the foe, who fled on
finding themselves thus disarmed. &lsquo;And now,&rsquo; says
Herodotus, &lsquo;there standeth a stone image of this king
in the temple of Heph&aelig;stus, and in the hand of the
image a mouse, and there is this inscription, &ldquo;Let
whoso looketh on me be pious.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Prof. Sayce<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> holds that there was no such person
as Sethos, but that the legend &lsquo;is evidently Egyptian,
not Greek, and the name of Sennacherib, as well as the
fact of the Assyrian attack, is correct.&rsquo; The legend
also, though Egyptian, is &lsquo;an echo of the biblical
account of the destruction of the Assyrian army,&rsquo; an
account which omits the mice. &lsquo;As to the mice,
here,&rsquo; says Prof. Sayce, &lsquo;we have to do again with
the Greek dragomen (<i>sic</i>). The story of Sethos was
attached to the statue of some deity which was supposed
to hold a mouse in its hand.&rsquo; It must have
been easy to verify this supposition; but Mr. Sayce
adds, &lsquo;mice were not sacred in Egypt, nor were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
they used as symbols, or found on the monuments.&rsquo;
To this remark we may suggest some exceptions.
Apparently this one mouse <em>was</em> found on the monuments.
Wilkinson (iii. 264) says mice do occur in the
sculptures, but they were not sacred. Rats, however,
were certainly sacred, and as little distinction is taken,
in myth, between rats and mice as between rabbits
and hares. The rat was sacred to Ra, the Sun-god,
and (like all totems) was not to be eaten.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> This association
of the rat and the Sun cannot but remind
us of Apollo and his mouse. According to Strabo, a
certain city of Egypt did worship the shrew-mouse.
The Athribit&aelig;, or dwellers in Crocodilopolis, are the
people to whom he attributes this cult, whom he
mentions (xvii. 831) among the other local animal-worships
of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Several porcelain examples of the
field-mouse sacred to Horus (commonly called Apollo
by the Greeks) may be seen in the British Museum.</p>

<p>That rats and field-mice were sacred in Egypt,
then, we may believe on the evidence of the Ritual
of Strabo, and of many relics of Egyptian art.
Herodotus, moreover, is credited when he says that
the statue &lsquo;had a mouse on its hand.&rsquo; Elsewhere,
it is certain that the story of the mice gnawing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
bowstrings occurs frequently as an explanation of
mouse-worship. One of the Trojan &lsquo;mouse-stories&rsquo;
ran&mdash;that emigrants had set out in prehistoric times
from Crete. The oracle advised them to settle
&lsquo;wherever they were attacked by the children of the
soil.&rsquo; At Hamaxitus in the Troad, they were assailed
in the night by mice, which ate all that was edible of
their armour and bowstrings. The colonists made
up their mind that these mice were &lsquo;the children of
the soil,&rsquo; settled there, and adored the mouse Apollo.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
A myth of this sort may either be a story invented
to explain the mouse-name; or a Mouse tribe, like the
Red Indian Wolves, or Crows, may actually have
been settled on the spot, and may even have resisted
invasion.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Another myth of the Troad accounted
for the worship of the mouse Apollo on the hypothesis
that he had once freed the land from mice, like
the Pied Piper of Hamelin, whose pipe (still serviceable)
is said to have been found in his grave by men
who were digging a mine.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Stories like these, stories attributing some great
deliverance to the mouse, or some deliverance from
mice to the god, would naturally spring up among
people puzzled by their own worship of the mouse-god
or of the mouse. We have explained the religious
character of mice as the relics of a past age in
which the mouse had been a totem and mouse family
names had been widely diffused. That there are,
and have been, mice totems and mouse family names
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
among Semitic stocks round the Mediterranean is
proved by Prof. Robertson Smith:<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> &lsquo;Achbor, the
mouse, is an Edomite name, apparently a stock
name, as the jerboa and another mouse-name are
among the Arabs. The same name occurs in Judah.&rsquo;
Where totemism exists, the members of each stock
either do not eat the ancestral animal at all, or only
eat him on rare sacrificial occasions. The totem
of a hostile stock may be eaten by way of insult.
In the case of the mouse, Isaiah seems to refer to
one or other of these practices (lxvi.): &lsquo;They that
sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the
gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine&rsquo;s
flesh, and the abomination, and the <em>mouse</em>, shall be
consumed together, saith the Lord.&rsquo; This is like the
Egyptian prohibition to eat &lsquo;the abominable&rsquo; (that
is, tabooed or forbidden) &lsquo;Rat of Ra.&rsquo; If the unclean
animals of Israel were originally the totems
of each clan, then the mouse was a totem,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> for the
chosen people were forbidden to eat &lsquo;the weasel, and
the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind.&rsquo; That
unclean beasts, beasts not to be eaten, were originally
totems, Prof. Robertson Smith infers from Ezekiel
(viii. 10, 11), where &lsquo;we find seventy of the elders of
Israel&mdash;that is, the heads of houses&mdash;worshipping in
a chamber which had on its walls the figures of all
manner of unclean&rsquo; (tabooed) &lsquo;creeping things, and
quadrupeds, <em>even all the idols of the House of Israel</em>.&rsquo;
Some have too hastily concluded that the mouse was
a sacred animal among the neighbouring Philistines.
After the Philistines had captured the Ark and set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
it in the house of Dagon, the people were smitten
with disease. They therefore, in accordance with a
well-known savage magical practice, made five golden
representations of the diseased part, and five golden
mice, as &lsquo;a trespass offering to the Lord of Israel,&rsquo;
and so restored the Ark.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Such votive offerings are
common still in Catholic countries, and the mice of
gold by no means prove that the Philistines had ever
worshipped mice.</p>


<p class="hrpad">Turning to India from the Mediterranean basin,
and the Aryan, Semitic, and Egyptian tribes on its
coasts, we find that the mouse was the sacred animal
of Rudra. &lsquo;The mouse, Rudra, is thy beast,&rsquo; says
the Yajur Veda, as rendered by Grohmann in his
<i>Apollo Smintheus</i>. Grohmann recognises in Rudra
a deity with most of the characteristics of Apollo.
In later Indian mythology, the mouse is an attribute
of Gane&ccedil;a, who, like Apollo Smintheus, is represented
in art with his foot upon a mouse.</p>

<p>Such are the chief appearances of the mouse in
ancient religion. If he really was a Semitic totem, it
may, perhaps, be argued that his prevalence in connection
with Apollo is the result of a Semitic leaven
in Hellenism. Hellenic invaders may have found
Semitic mouse-tribes at home, and incorporated the
alien stock deity with their own Apollo-worship. In
that case the mouse, while still originally a totem,
would not be an Aryan totem. But probably the
myths and rites of the mouse, and their diffusion, are
more plausibly explained on our theory than on that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
De Gubernatis: &lsquo;The Pagan Sun-god crushes under
his foot the Mouse of Night. When the cat&rsquo;s away,
the mice may play; the shadows of night dance when
the moon is absent.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> This is one of the quaintest
pieces of mythological logic. Obviously, when the
cat (the moon) is away, the mice (the shadows)
<em>cannot</em> play: there is no light to produce a shadow.
As usually chances, the Scholars who try to resolve
all the features of myth into physical phenomena
do not agree among themselves about the mouse.
While the mouse is the night according to M. de
Gubernatis, in Grohmann&rsquo;s opinion the mouse is the
lightning. He argues that the lightning was originally
regarded by the Aryan race as the &lsquo;flashing tooth
of a beast,&rsquo; especially of a mouse. Afterwards men
came to identify the beast with his teeth, and, behold
the lightning and the mouse are convertible mythical
terms! Now it is perfectly true that savages regard
many elemental phenomena, from eclipses to the
rainbow, as the result of the action of animals. The
rainbow is a serpent;<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> thunder is caused by the
thunder-bird, who has actually been shot in Dacotah,
and who is familiar to the Zulus; while rain is
the milk of a heavenly cow&mdash;an idea recurring in
the <i>Zend Avesta</i>. But it does not follow because
savages believe in these meteorological beasts that
all the beasts in myth were originally meteorological.
Man raised a serpent to the skies, perhaps, but his interest
in the animal began on earth, not in the clouds.
It is excessively improbable, and quite unproved, that
any race ever regarded lightning as the flashes of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
mouse&rsquo;s teeth. The hypothesis is a <i>jeu d&rsquo;esprit</i>, like
the opposite hypothesis about the mouse of Night.
In these, and all the other current theories of the
Sminthian Apollo, the widely diffused worship of
ordinary mice, and such small deer, has been either
wholly neglected, or explained by the first theory of
symbolism that occurred to the conjecture of a civilised
observer. The facts of savage animal-worship,
and their relations to totemism, seem still unknown
to or unappreciated by Scholars, with the exception
of Mr. Sayce, who recognises totemism as the origin
of the zoomorphic element in Egyptian religion.</p>

<p>Our explanation, whether adequate or not, is not
founded on an isolated case. If Apollo superseded
and absorbed the worship of the mouse, he did no
less for the wolf, the ram, the dolphin, and several
other animals whose images were associated with
his own. The Greek religion was more refined and
anthropomorphic than that of Egypt. In Egypt
the animals were still adored, and the images of
the gods had bestial heads. In Greece only a few
gods, and chiefly in very archaic statues, had bestial
heads; but besides the other deities the sculptor set
the owl, eagle, wolf, serpent, tortoise, mouse, or whatever
creature was the local favourite of the deity.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
Probably the deity had, in the majority of cases,
superseded the animal and succeeded to his honours.
But the conservative religious sentiment retained the
beast within the courts and in the suit and service of
the anthropomorphic god.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
The process by which the god ousted the beasts
may perhaps be observed in Samoa. There (as Dr.
Turner tells us in his <i>Samoa</i>) each family has its
own sacred animal, which it may not eat. If this
law be transgressed, the malefactor is supernaturally
punished in a variety of ways. But, while each
family has thus its totem, four or five different
families recognise, in owl, crab, lizard, and so on, incarnations
of the same god, say of Tongo. If Tongo
had a temple among these families, we can readily
believe that images of the various beasts in which he
was incarnate would be kept within the consecrated
walls. Savage ideas like these, if they were ever
entertained in Greece, would account for the holy
animals of the different deities. But it is obvious
that the phenomena which we have been studying
may be otherwise explained. It may be said that
the Sminthian Apollo was only revered as the
enemy and opponent of mice. St. Gertrude (whose
heart was eaten by mice) has the same <i>r&ocirc;le</i> in France.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
The worship of Apollo, and the badge of the mouse,
would, on this principle, be diffused by colonies from
some centre of the faith. The images of mice in
Apollo&rsquo;s temples would be nothing more than votive
offerings. Thus, in the church of a Saxon town, the
verger shows a silver mouse dedicated to Our Lady.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
&lsquo;This is the greatest of our treasures,&rsquo; says the verger.
&lsquo;Our town was overrun with mice till the ladies of
the city offered this mouse of silver. Instantly all
the mice disappeared.&rsquo; &lsquo;And are you such fools as
to believe that the creatures went away because a
silver mouse was dedicated?&rsquo; asked a Prussian officer.
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the verger, rather neatly; &lsquo;or long ago
we should have offered a silver Prussian.&rsquo;</p>

The names <em>Totem</em> and <em>Totemism</em> have been in use at least since
1792, among writers on the North American tribes. Prof. Max
M&uuml;ller (<i>Academy</i>, Jan., 1884) says the word should be, not <em>Totem</em>, but
<em>Ote</em> or <em>Otem</em>. Mr. Tylor&rsquo;s inquiries among the Red Men support this.
Long, an interpreter among the Indians, introduced the word <em>Totamism</em>
in 1792; but Lafitau (1724) had already explained some classical myths
as survivals of Totemism.</p>

The Mouse, according to Dalton, is still a totem among the
Oraons of Bengal. A man of the Mouse &lsquo;motherhood,&rsquo; as the totem
kindred is locally styled, may not eat mice (esteemed a delicacy), nor
marry a girl who is a Mouse.</p>

represented with his bow, and the mouse on his hand. Other coins
show the god with the mouse at his foot, or show us the lyre of Apollo
supported by mice. A bronze coin in the British Museum gives

Liebrecht (<i>Zur Volkskunde</i>, p. 13, quoting <i>Journal Asiatique</i>,
1st series, 3, 307) finds the same myth in Chinese annals. It is not
a god, however, but the king of the rats who appears to the distressed
monarch in his dream. Rats then gnaw the bowstrings of his
enemies. The invaders were Turks, the rescued prince a king of
Khotan. The king raised a temple, and offered sacrifice&mdash;to the rats?
The same story of rats gnawing bowstrings recurs, of all places, in the
<i>Migration Legend of the Greeks</i> (Brinton, Philadelphia. 1884).</p>

Mr. Loftie has kindly shown me a green mouse containing the

as substitutes for scarabs were also sacred, as the fish,
rhinoceros, fly, all represented in Mr. Loftie&rsquo;s collection.
See his <i>Essay of Scarabs</i>, p. 27. It may
be admitted that, in a country where Cats were gods,
the religion of the Mouse must have been struggling and oppressed.</p>

This hypothesis does not maintain that totemism prevailed in
Greece during historic times. Though Plutarch mentions a Carian
<ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>, the Ioxid&aelig;, of Attic descent, which revered asparagus, it is
probable that genuine totemism had died out of Greece many hundreds
of years before even Homer&rsquo;s time. But this view is not inconsistent
with the existence of survivals in religion and ritual.</p>

<h2><a name="chap07" id="chap07"></a><i>STAR MYTHS.</i></h2>


<p>Artemus Ward used to say that, while there were
many things in the science of astronomy hard to be
understood, there was one fact which entirely puzzled
him. He could partly perceive how we &lsquo;weigh the
sun,&rsquo; and ascertain the component elements of the
heavenly bodies, by the aid of <em>spectrum</em> analysis.
&lsquo;But what beats me about the stars,&rsquo; he observed
plaintively, &lsquo;is how we come to know their names.&rsquo;
This question, or rather the somewhat similar question,
&lsquo;How did the constellations come by their very
peculiar names?&rsquo; has puzzled Professor Pritchard and
other astronomers more serious than Artemus Ward.
Why is a group of stars called the <i>Bear</i>, or the
<i>Swan</i>, or the <i>Twins</i>, or named after the <i>Pleiades</i>, the
fair daughters of the Giant Atlas?<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> These are difficulties
that meet even children when they examine a
&lsquo;celestial globe.&rsquo; There they find the figure of a bear,
traced out with lines in the intervals between the
stars of the constellations, while a very imposing giant
is so drawn that Orion&rsquo;s belt just fits his waist. But
when he comes to look at the heavens, the infant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
speculator sees no sort of likeness to a bear in the
stars, nor anything at all resembling a giant in the
neighbourhood of Orion. The most eccentric modern
fancy which can detect what shapes it will in clouds,
is unable to find any likeness to human or animal
forms in the stars, and yet we call a great many of
the stars by the names of men and beasts and gods.
Some resemblance to terrestrial things, it is true,
every one can behold in the heavens. <i>Corona</i>, for example,
is like a crown, or, as the Australian black
fellows know, it is like a boomerang, and we can
understand why they give it the name of that curious
curved missile. The <i>Milky Way</i>, again, does resemble
a path in the sky; our English ancestors called it
<i>Watling Street</i>&mdash;the path of the Watlings, mythical
giants&mdash;and Bushmen in Africa and Red Men in
North America name it the &lsquo;ashen path&rsquo; or &lsquo;the path
of souls.&rsquo; The ashes of the path, of course, are supposed
to be hot and glowing, not dead and black
like the ash-paths of modern running-grounds. Other
and more recent names for certain constellations are
also intelligible. In Homer&rsquo;s time the Greeks had
two names for the <i>Great Bear</i>; they called it the
<i>Bear</i>, or the <i>Wain</i>: and a certain fanciful likeness to
a wain may be made out, though no resemblance to
a bear is manifest. In the United States the same
constellation is popularly styled the <i>Dipper</i>, and every
one may observe the likeness to a dipper or toddy-ladle.</p>

<p>But these resemblances take us only a little
way towards appellations. We know that we derive
many of the names straight from the Greek; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
whence did the Greeks get them? Some, it is said,
from the Chald&aelig;ans; but whence did they reach the
Chald&aelig;ans? To this we shall return later, but, as to
early Greek star-lore, Goguet, the author of <i>L&rsquo;Origine
des Lois</i>, a rather learned but too speculative work of
the last century, makes the following characteristic
remarks: &lsquo;The Greeks received their astronomy from
Prometheus. This prince, as far as history teaches
us, made his observations on Mount Caucasus.&rsquo; That
was the eighteenth century&rsquo;s method of interpreting
mythology. The myth preserved in the &lsquo;Prometheus
Bound&rsquo; of &AElig;schylus tells us that Zeus crucified the
Titan on Mount Caucasus. The French philosopher,
rejecting the supernatural elements of the tale, makes
up his mind that Prometheus was a prince of a scientific
bent, and that he established his observatory on
the frosty Caucasus. But, even admitting this, why
did Prometheus give the stars animal names? Goguet
easily explains this by a hypothetical account of the
manners of primitive men. &lsquo;The earliest peoples,&rsquo; he
says, &lsquo;must have used writing for purposes of astronomical
science. They would be content to design
the constellations of which they wished to speak by
the hieroglyphical symbols of their names; hence the
constellations have insensibly taken the names of the
chief symbols.&rsquo; Thus, a drawing of a bear or a swan
was the hieroglyphic of the name of a star, or group
of stars. But whence came the name which was
represented by the hieroglyphic? That is precisely
what our author forgets to tell us. But he remarks
that the meaning of the hieroglyphic came to be forgotten,
and &lsquo;the symbols gave rise to all the ridiculous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
tales about the heavenly signs.&rsquo; This explanation
is attained by the process of reasoning in a vicious
circle from hypothetical premises ascertained to be
false. All the known savages of the world, even those
which have scarcely the elements of picture-writing,
call the constellations by the names of men and
animals, and all tell &lsquo;ridiculous tales&rsquo; to account for
the names.</p>

<p>As the star-stories told by the Greeks, the ancient
Egyptians, and other civilised people of the old world,
exactly correspond in character, and sometimes even
in incident, with the star-stories of modern savages,
we have the choice of three hypothesis to explain this
curious coincidence. Perhaps the star-stories, about
nymphs changed into bears, and bears changed into
stars, were invented by the civilised races of old, and
gradually found their way amongst people like the
Eskimo, and the Australians, and Bushmen. Or
it may be insisted that the ancestors of Australians,
Eskimo, and Bushmen were once civilised, like the
Greeks and Egyptians, and invented star-stories, still
remembered by their degenerate descendants. These
are the two forms of the explanation which will be
advanced by persons who believe that the star-stories
were originally the fruit of the civilised imagination.
The third theory would be, that the &lsquo;ridiculous tales&rsquo;
about the stars were originally the work of the savage
imagination, and that the Greeks, Chald&aelig;ans, and
Egyptians, when they became civilised, retained the
old myths that their ancestors had invented when
they were savages. In favour of this theory it may
be said, briefly, that there is no proof that the fathers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
of Australians, Eskimo, and Bushmen had ever been
civilised, while there is a great deal of evidence
to suggest that the fathers of the Greeks had once
been savages.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> And, if we incline to the theory
that the star-myths are the creation of savage fancy,
we at once learn why they are, in all parts of the
world, so much alike. Just as the flint and bone
weapons of rude races resemble each other much
more than they resemble the metal weapons and the
artillery of advanced peoples, so the mental products,
the fairy tales, and myths of rude races have
everywhere a strong family resemblance. They are
produced by men in similar mental conditions of
ignorance, curiosity, and credulous fancy, and they
are intended to supply the same needs, partly of
amusing narrative, partly of crude explanation of
familiar phenomena.</p>

<p>Now it is time to prove the truth of our assertion
that the star-stories of savage and of civilised races
closely resemble each other. Let us begin with that
well-known group the <i>Pleiades</i>. The peculiarity of
the <i>Pleiades</i> is that the group consists of seven stars,
of which one is so dim that it seems entirely to
disappear, and many persons can only detect its
presence through a telescope. The Greeks had a
myth to account for the vanishing of the lost Pleiad.
The tale is given in the <i>Catasterismoi</i> (stories of
metamorphoses into stars) attributed to Eratosthenes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
This work was probably written after our era; but
the author derived his information from older treatises
now lost. According to the Greek myth, then,
the seven stars of the Pleiad were seven maidens,
daughters of the Giant Atlas. Six of them had gods
for lovers; Poseidon admired two of them, Zeus
three, and Ares one; but the seventh had only an
earthly wooer, and when all of them were changed
into stars, the maiden with the mortal lover hid her
light for shame.</p>

<p>Now let us compare the Australian story. According
to Mr. Dawson (<i>Australian Aborigines</i>), a writer
who understands the natives well, &lsquo;their knowledge
of the heavenly bodies greatly exceeds that of most
white people,&rsquo; and &lsquo;is taught by men selected for their
intelligence and information. The knowledge is important
to the aborigines on their night journeys;&rsquo;
so we may be sure that the natives are careful observers
of the heavens, and are likely to be conservative
of their astronomical myths. The &lsquo;Lost Pleiad&rsquo; has
not escaped them, and this is how they account for
her disappearance. The <i>Pirt Kopan noot</i> tribe have a
tradition that the <i>Pleiades</i> were a queen and her six
attendants. Long ago the <i>Crow</i> (our <i>Canopus</i>) fell in
love with the queen, who refused to be his wife. The
<i>Crow</i> found that the queen and her six maidens, like
other Australian <i>gins</i>, were in the habit of hunting for
white edible grubs in the bark of trees. The <i>Crow</i> at
once changed himself into a grub (just as Jupiter and
Indra used to change into swans, horses, ants, or what
not) and hid in the bark of a tree. The six maidens
sought to pick him out with their wooden hooks, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
he broke the points of all the hooks. Then came the
queen with her pretty bone hook; he let himself be
drawn out, took the shape of a giant, and ran away
with her. Ever since there have only been six stars,
the six maidens, in the <i>Pleiad</i>. This story is well
known, by the strictest inquiry, to be current among
the blacks of the West District and South Australia.</p>

<p>Mr. Tylor, whose opinion is entitled to the
highest respect, thinks that this may be a European
myth, told by some settler to a black in the Greek
form, and then spread about among the natives. He
complains that the story of the loss of the <em>brightest</em>
star does not fit the facts of the case.</p>

<p>We do not know, and how can the Australians
know, that the lost star was once the brightest? It
appears to me that the Australians, remarking the
disappearance of a star, might very naturally suppose
that the <i>Crow</i> had selected for his wife that one which
had been the most brilliant of the cluster. Besides,
the wide distribution of the tale among the natives,
and the very great change in the nature of the incidents,
seem to point to a native origin. Though the
main conception&mdash;the loss of one out of seven maidens&mdash;is
identical in Greek and in <i>Murri</i>, the manner of
the disappearance is eminently Hellenic in the one
case, eminently savage in the other. However this
may be, nothing of course is proved by a single
example. Let us next examine the stars <i>Castor</i>
and <i>Pollux</i>. Both in Greece and in Australia these
are said once to have been two young men. In
the <i>Catasterismoi</i>, already spoken of, we read: &lsquo;The
<i>Twins</i>, or <i>Dioscouroi</i>.&mdash;They were nurtured in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
Laced&aelig;mon, and were famous for their brotherly love,
wherefore, Zeus, desiring to make their memory
immortal, placed them both among the stars.&rsquo; In
Australia, according to Mr. Brough Smyth (<i>Aborigines
of Victoria</i>), <i>Turree</i> (<i>Castor</i>) and <i>Wanjel</i> (<i>Pollux</i>) are
two young men who pursue <i>Purra</i> and kill him at
the commencement of the great heat. <i>Coonar toorung</i>
(the mirage) is the smoke of the fire by which they
roast him. In Greece it was not Castor and Pollux, but
<i>Orion</i> who was the great hunter placed among the
stars. Among the Bushmen of South Africa, <i>Castor</i>
and <i>Pollux</i> are not young men, but young women, the
wives of the Eland, the great native antelope. In
Greek star-stories the <i>Great Bear</i> keeps watch, Homer
says, on the hunter Orion for fear of a sudden attack.
But how did the Bear get its name in Greece?
According to Hesiod, the oldest Greek poet after
Homer, the Bear was once a lady, daughter of
Lycaon, King of Arcadia. She was a nymph of the
train of chaste Artemis, but yielded to the love of
Zeus, and became the ancestress of all the Arcadians.
Changed by Zeus to a bestial form, she was shot by
Artemis, and then translated by Zeus to the stars
(Apollod., iii. 8; Eustath., 1156; Bachofen, <i>Der B&auml;r</i>,
p. 14).<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Here we must notice first, that the Arcadians,
like Australians, Red Indians, and other wild
races, and like the Bedouins, believed themselves to
be descended from a girl who became an animal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
That the early Egyptians did the same is not improbable;
for names of animals are found among
the ancestors in the very oldest genealogical papyrus,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
as in the genealogies of the old English kings.
Next the Arcadians transferred the ancestral bear
to the heavens, and, in doing this, they resembled
the Peruvians, of whom Acosta says: &lsquo;They adored
the star <i>Urchuchilly</i>, feigning it to be a <i>Ram</i>, and
worshipped two others, and say that one of them is a
<i>sheep</i>, and the other a lamb ... others worshipped
the star called the <i>Tiger</i>. <em>They were of opinion that
there was not any beast or bird upon the earth, whose
shape or image did not shine in the heavens.</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p>But to return to our bears. The Australians have,
properly speaking, no bears, though the animal called
the native bear is looked up to by the aborigines with
superstitious regard. But among the North American
Indians, as the old missionaries Lafitau and Charlevoix
observed, &lsquo;the four stars in front of our constellation
are a bear; those in the tail are hunters who pursue
him; the small star apart is the pot in which they
mean to cook him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It may be held that the Red Men derived their
bear from the European settlers. But, as we have
seen, an exact knowledge of the stars has always
been useful if not essential to savages; and we
venture to doubt whether they would confuse their
nomenclature and sacred traditions by borrowing
terms from trappers and squatters. But, if this is
improbable, it seems almost impossible that all
savage races should have borrowed their whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
conception of the heavenly bodies from the myths of
Greece. It is thus that Egede, a missionary of the
last century, describes the Eskimo philosophy of
the stars: &lsquo;The notions that the Greenlanders have
as to the origin of the heavenly lights&mdash;as sun, moon,
and stars&mdash;are very nonsensical; in that they pretend
they have formerly been as many of their own ancestors,
who, on different accounts, were lifted up to
heaven, and became such glorious celestial bodies.&rsquo;
Again, he writes: &lsquo;Their notions about the stars are
that some of them have been men, and others different
sorts of animals and fishes.&rsquo; But every reader of Ovid
knows that this was the very mythical theory of the
Greeks and Romans. The Egyptians, again, worshipped
Osiris, Isis, and the rest as <em>ancestors</em>, and
there are even modern scholars, like Mr. Loftie in his
<i>Essay of Scarabs</i>, who hold Osiris to have been
originally a real historical person. But the Egyptian
priests who showed Plutarch the grave of Osiris,
showed him, too, the stars into which Osiris, Isis,
and Horus had been metamorphosed. Here, then,
we have Greeks, Egyptians, and Eskimo, all agreed
about the origin of the heavenly lights, all of opinion
that &lsquo;they have formerly been as many of their own
ancestors.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Australian general theory is: &lsquo;Of the good
men and women, after the deluge, Pundjel (a kind of
Zeus, or rather a sort of Prometheus of Australian
mythology) made stars. Sorcerers (<i>Biraark</i>) can tell
which stars were once good men and women.&rsquo; Here
the sorcerers have the same knowledge as the Egyptian
priests. Again, just as among the Arcadians,

&lsquo;the progenitors of the existing tribes, whether birds,
or beasts, or men, were set in the sky, and made to
shine as stars.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>We have already given some Australian examples
in the stories of the <i>Pleiades</i>, and of <i>Castor</i> and
<i>Pollux</i>. We may add the case of the <i>Eagle</i>. In
Greece the <i>Eagle</i> was the bird of Zeus, who carried
off Ganymede to be the cup-bearer of Olympus.
Among the Australians this same constellation is
called <i>Totyarguil</i>; he was a man who, when bathing,
was killed by a fabulous animal, a kind of kelpie; as
Orion, in Greece, was killed by the <i>Scorpion</i>. Like
Orion, he was placed among the stars. The Australians
have a constellation named <i>Eagle</i>, but he is our
<i>Sirius</i>, or <i>Dog-star</i>.</p>

<p>The Indians of the Amazon are in one tale with
the Australians and Eskimo. &lsquo;Dr. Silva de Coutinho
informs me,&rsquo; says Professor Hartt,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> &lsquo;that the Indians
of the Amazonas not only give names to many of the
heavenly bodies, but also tell stories about them.
The two stars that form the shoulders of Orion are
said to be an old man and a boy in a canoe, chasing
a <i>peixe boi</i>, by which name is designated a dark spot in
the sky near the above constellation.&rsquo; The Indians also
know monkey-stars, crane-stars, and palm-tree stars.</p>

<p>The Bushmen, almost the lowest tribe of South
Africa, have the same star-lore and much the same
myths as the Greeks, Australians, Egyptians, and
Eskimo. According to Dr. Bleek, &lsquo;stars, and even
the sun and moon, were once mortals on earth, or
even animals or inorganic substances, which happened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
to get translated to the skies. The sun was once a
man whose arm-pit radiated a limited amount of light
round his house. Some children threw him into the
sky, and there he shines.&rsquo; The Homeric hymn to
Helios, in the same way, as Mr. Max M&uuml;ller observes,
&lsquo;looks on the sun as a half-god, almost a hero, who
had once lived on earth.&rsquo; The pointers of the
Southern Cross were &lsquo;two men who were lions,&rsquo; just
as Callisto, in Arcadia, was a woman who was a
bear. It is not at all rare in those queer philosophies,
as in that of the Scandinavians, to find that the sun or
moon has been a man or woman. In Australian fable
the moon was a man, the sun a woman of indifferent
character, who appears at dawn in a coat of red kangaroo
skins, the present of an admirer. In an old Mexican
text the moon was a man, across whose face a god
threw a rabbit, thus making the marks in the moon.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Many separate races seem to recognise the figure
of a hare, where we see &lsquo;the Man in the Moon.&rsquo; In
a Buddhist legend, an exemplary and altruistic hare
was translated to the moon. &lsquo;To the common people
in India the spots on the moon look like a hare, and
Chandras, the god of the moon, carries a hare: hence
the moon is called <i>sasin</i> or <i>sasanka</i>, hare-mark. The
Mongolians also see in these shadows the figure of a
hare.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Among the Eskimo, the moon is a girl, who
always flees from her cruel brother, the sun, because
he disfigured her face. Elsewhere the sun is the girl,
beloved by her own brother, the moon; she blackens
her face to avert his affection. On the Rio Branco,
and among the Tomunda, the moon is a girl who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
loved her brother and visited him in the dark. He
detected her wicked passion by drawing his blackened
hand over her face. The marks betrayed her,
and, as the spots on the moon, remain to this day.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Among the New Zealanders and North American
Indians the sun is a great beast, whom the hunters
trapped and thrashed with cudgels. His blood is
used in some New Zealand incantations; and, according
to an Egyptian myth, was kneaded into clay
at the making of man. But there is no end to
similar sun-myths, in all of which the sun is regarded
as a man, or even as a beast.</p>

<p>To return to the stars&mdash;</p>

<p>The Red Indians, as Schoolcraft says, &lsquo;hold many
of the planets to be transformed adventurers.&rsquo; The
Iowas &lsquo;believed stars to be a sort of living creatures.&rsquo;
One of them came down and talked to a hunter, and
showed him where to find game. The Gallinomeros
of Central California, according to Mr. Bancroft,
believe that the sun and moon were made and lighted
up by the Hawk and the Coyote, who one day flew
into each other&rsquo;s faces in the dark, and were determined
to prevent such accidents in the future. But
the very oddest example of the survival of the notion
that the stars are men or women is found in the
&lsquo;Pax&rsquo; of Aristophanes. Tryg&aelig;us in that comedy has
just made an expedition to heaven. A slave meets
him, and asks him, &lsquo;Is not the story true, then, that
we become stars when we die?&rsquo; The answer is,
&lsquo;Certainly&rsquo;; and Tryg&aelig;us points out the star into
which Ios of Chios has just been metamorphosed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
Aristophanes is making fun of some popular Greek
superstition. But that very superstition meets us in
New Zealand. &lsquo;Heroes,&rsquo; says Mr. Tylor, &lsquo;were
thought to become stars of greater or less brightness,
according to the number of their victims slain in fight.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Aryan race is seldom far behind, when there
are ludicrous notions to be credited or savage tales
to be told. We have seen that Aristophanes, in
Greece, knew the Eskimo doctrine that stars are souls
of the dead. The Persians had the same belief,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> &lsquo;all
the unnumbered stars were reckoned ghosts of men.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
The German folklore clings to the same belief, &lsquo;Stars
are souls; when a child dies God makes a new star.&rsquo;
Kaegi quotes<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> the same idea from the Veda, and
from the Satapatha Brahmana the thoroughly Australian
notion that &lsquo;good men become stars.&rsquo; For
a truly savage conception, it would be difficult, in
South Africa or on the Amazons, to beat the following
story from the <i>Aitareya Brahmana</i> (iii. 33).
Pragapati, the Master of Life, conceived an incestuous
passion for his own daughter. Like Zeus, and Indra,
and the Austrian wooer in the Pleiad tale, he concealed
himself under the shape of a beast, a roebuck,
and approached his own daughter, who had assumed
the form of a doe. The gods, in anger at the awful
crime, made a monster to punish Pragapati. The
monster sent an arrow through the god&rsquo;s body; he
sprang into heaven, and, like the Arcadian bear, this
Aryan roebuck became a constellation. He is
among the stars of Orion, and his punisher, also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
now a star, is, like the Greek Orion, a hunter. The
daughter of Pragapati, the doe, became another constellation,
and the avenging arrow is also a set of stars
in the sky. What follows, about the origin of the
gods called Adityas, is really too savage to be quoted
by a chaste mythologist.</p>

<p>It would be easy to multiply examples of this
stage of thought among Aryans and savages. But
we have probably brought forward enough for our
purpose, and have expressly chosen instances from
the most widely separated peoples. These instances,
it will perhaps be admitted, suggest, if they do not
prove, that the Greeks had received from tradition
precisely the same sort of legends about the heavenly
bodies as are current among Eskimo and Bushmen,
New Zealanders and Iowas. As much, indeed,
might be inferred from our own astronomical nomenclature.
We now give to newly discovered stars
names derived from distinguished people, as <i>Georgium
Sidus</i>, or <i>Herschel</i>; or, again, merely technical appellatives,
as <i>Alpha</i>, <i>Beta</i>, and the rest. We should never
think when &lsquo;some new planet swims into our ken&rsquo; of
calling it <i>Kangaroo</i>, or <i>Rabbit</i>, or after the name of
some hero of romance, as <i>Rob Roy</i>, or <i>Count Fosco</i>.
But the names of stars which we inherit from Greek
mythology&mdash;the <i>Bear</i>, the <i>Pleiades</i>, <i>Castor</i> and <i>Pollux</i>,
and so forth&mdash;are such as no people in our mental
condition would originally think of bestowing. When
Callimachus and the courtly astronomers of Alexandria
pretended that the golden locks of Berenice
were raised to the heavens, that was a mere piece of
flattery constructed on the inherited model of legends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
about the crown (<i>Corona</i>) of Ariadne. It seems
evident enough that the older Greek names of stars
are derived from a time when the ancestors of the
Greeks were in the mental and imaginative condition
of Iowas, Kanekas, Bushmen, Murri, and New Zealanders.
All these, and all other savage peoples,
believe in a kind of equality and intercommunion
among all things animate and inanimate. Stones are
supposed in the Pacific Islands to be male and female
and to propagate their species. Animals are believed
to have human or superhuman intelligence, and speech,
if they choose to exercise the gift. Stars are just on
the same footing, and their movements are explained
by the same ready system of universal anthropomorphism.
Stars, fishes, gods, heroes, men, trees, clouds,
and animals, all play their equal part in the confused
dramas of savage thought and savage mythology.
Even in practical life the change of a sorcerer into an
animal is accepted as a familiar phenomenon, and the
power of soaring among the stars is one on which
the Australian Biraark, or the Eskimo Shaman, most
plumes himself. It is not wonderful that things which
are held possible in daily practice should be frequent
features of mythology. Hence the ready invention
and belief of star-legends, which in their turn fix the
names of the heavenly bodies. Nothing more, except
the extreme tenacity of tradition and the inconvenience
of changing a widely accepted name, is needed
to account for the human and animal names of the
stars. The Greeks received from the dateless past of
savage intellect the myths, and the names of the constellations,
and we have taken them, without inquiry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
from the Greeks. Thus it happens that our celestial
globes are just as queer menageries as any globes could
be that were illustrated by Australians or American
Indians, by Bushmen or Peruvian aborigines, or Eskimo.
It was savages, we may be tolerably certain,
who first handed to science the names of the constellations,
and provided Greece with the raw material
of her astronomical myths&mdash;as Bacon prettily says,
that we listen to the harsh ideas of earlier peoples
&lsquo;blown softly through the flutes of the Grecians.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This position has been disputed by Mr. Brown,
in a work called <i>The Law of Kosmic Order</i>. Mr.
Brown&rsquo;s theory is that the early Accadians named
the zodiacal signs after certain myths and festivals
connected with the months. Thus the crab is a
figure of &lsquo;the darkness power&rsquo; which seized the
Accadian solar hero, Dumuzi, and &lsquo;which is constantly
represented in monstrous and drakontic form.&rsquo;
The bull, again, is connected with night and darkness,
&lsquo;in relation to the horned moon,&rsquo; and is, for
other reasons, &lsquo;a nocturnal potency.&rsquo; Few stars, to
tell the truth, are diurnal potencies. Mr. Brown&rsquo;s
explanations appear to me far-fetched and unconvincing.
But, granting that the zodiacal signs reached
Greece from Chald&aelig;a, Mr. Brown will hardly maintain
that Australians, Melanesians, Iowas, Amazon Indians,
Eskimo, and the rest, borrowed their human and
animal stars from &lsquo;Akkadia.&rsquo; The belief in animal
and human stars is practically universal among
savages who have not attained the &lsquo;Akkadian&rsquo;
degree of culture. The belief, as Mr. Tylor has
shown,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> is a natural result of savage ideas. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
therefore infer that the &lsquo;Akkadians,&rsquo; too, probably
fell back for star-names on what they inherited from
the savage past. If the Greeks borrowed certain
star-names from the &lsquo;Akkadians,&rsquo; they also, like the
Aryans of India, retained plenty of savage star-myths
of their own, fables derived from the earliest astronomical
guesses of early thought.</p>

<p>The first moment in astronomical science arrives
when the savage, looking at a star, says, like the child
in the nursery poem, &lsquo;How I wonder what you are!&rsquo;
The next moment comes when the savage has made
his first rough practical observations of the movements
of the heavenly body. His third step is to
explain these to himself. Now science cannot offer
any but a fanciful explanation beyond the sphere of
experience. The experience of the savage is limited
to the narrow world of his tribe, and of the beasts,
birds, and fishes of his district. His philosophy,
therefore, accounts for all phenomena on the supposition
that the laws of the animate nature he observes
are working everywhere. But his observations, misguided
by his crude magical superstitions, have led
him to believe in a state of equality and kinship
between men and animals, and even inorganic things.
He often worships the very beasts he slays; he
addresses them as if they understood him; he
believes himself to be descended from the animals,
and of their kindred. These confused ideas he
applies to the stars, and recognises in them men like
himself, or beasts like those with which he conceives
himself to be in such close human relations. There
is scarcely a bird or beast but the Red Indian or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
Australian will explain its peculiarities by a myth,
like a page from Ovid&rsquo;s <i>Metamorphoses</i>. It was
once a man or a woman, and has been changed to
bird or beast by a god or a magician. Men, again,
have originally been beasts, in his philosophy, and
are descended from wolves, frogs, or serpents, or
monkeys. The heavenly bodies are traced to precisely
the same sort of origin; and hence, we conclude,
come their strange animal names, and the strange
myths about them which appear in all ancient poetry.
These names, in turn, have curiously affected human
beliefs. Astrology is based on the opinion that a
man&rsquo;s character and fate are determined by the stars
under which he is born. And the nature of these
stars is deduced from their names, so that the bear
should have been found in the horoscope of Dr. Johnson.
When Giordano Bruno wrote his satire against
religion, the famous &lsquo;Spaccio della bestia trionfante,&rsquo;
he proposed to banish not only the gods but the beasts
from heaven. He would call the stars, not the <i>Bear</i>,
or the <i>Swan</i>, or the <i>Pleiades</i>, but Truth, Mercy, Justice,
and so forth, that men might be born, not under bestial,
but moral influences. But the beasts have had too long
possession of the stars to be easily dislodged, and the
tenure of the <i>Bear</i> and the <i>Swan</i> will probably last as
long as there is a science of Astronomy. Their names
are not likely again to delude a philosopher into the
opinion of Aristotle that the stars are animated.</p>

<p>This argument had been worked out to the writer&rsquo;s
satisfaction when he chanced to light on Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s explanation of the name of the <i>Great Bear</i>.
We have explained that name as only one out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
countless similar appellations which men of every
race give to the stars. These names, again, we have
accounted for as the result of savage philosophy,
which takes no great distinction between man and
the things in the world, and looks on stars, beasts, birds,
fishes, flowers, and trees as men and women in disguise.
Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s theory is based on philological
considerations. He thinks that the name of the
<i>Great Bear</i> is the result of a mistake as to the meaning
of words. There was in Sanskrit, he says,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> a
root <i>ark</i>, or <i>arch</i>, meaning &lsquo;to be bright.&rsquo; She-stars
are called <i>riksha</i>, that is, bright ones, in the Veda.
&lsquo;The constellations here called the Rikshas, in the
sense of the &ldquo;bright ones,&rdquo; would be homonymous
in Sanskrit with the Bears. Remember also that,
apparently without rhyme or reason, the same constellation
is called by Greeks and Romans the Bear....
There is not the shadow of a likeness with a
bear. You will now perceive the influence of words
on thought, or the spontaneous growth of mythology.
The name <i>Riksha</i> was applied to the bear in the sense
of the bright fuscous animal, and in that sense it
became most popular in the later Sanskrit, and in
Greek and Latin. The same name, &ldquo;in the sense of
the bright ones,&rdquo; had been applied by the Vedic poets
to the stars in general, and more particularly to that
constellation which in the northern parts of India
was the most prominent. The etymological meaning,
&ldquo;the bright stars,&rdquo; was forgotten; the popular
meaning of Riksha (bear) was known to every one.
And thus it happened that, when the Greeks had left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
their central home and settled in Europe, they retained
the name of Arktos for the same unchanging
stars; but, not knowing why those stars had originally
received that name, they ceased to speak of them as
<i>arkto&iacute;</i>, or many bears, and spoke of them as the Bear.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This is a very good example of the philological
way of explaining a myth. If once we admit that
<i>ark</i>, or <i>arch</i>, in the sense of &lsquo;bright&rsquo; and of &lsquo;bear,&rsquo;
existed, not only in Sanskrit, but in the undivided
Aryan tongue, and that the name Riksha, bear,
&lsquo;became in that sense most popular in Greek and
Latin,&rsquo; this theory seems more than plausible. But
the explanation does not look so well if we examine,
not only the Aryan, but all the known myths and
names of the Bear and the other stars. Professor
Sayce, a distinguished philologist, says we may not
compare non-Aryan with Aryan myths. We have
ventured to do so, however, in this paper, and have
shown that the most widely severed races give the
stars animal names, of which the <i>Bear</i> is one example.
Now, if the philologists wish to persuade us that
it was decaying and half-forgotten language which
caused men to give the names of animals to the stars,
they must prove their case on an immense collection of
instances&mdash;on Iowa, Kaneka, Murri, Maori, Brazilian,
Peruvian, Mexican, Egyptian, Eskimo, instances.
It would be the most amazing coincidence in the
world if forgetfulness of the meaning of their own
speech compelled tribes of every tongue and race to
recognise men and beasts, cranes, cockatoos, serpents,
monkeys, bears, and so forth in the heavens. How
came the misunderstood words always to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
misunderstood in the same way? Does the philological
explanation account for the enormous majority of the
phenomena? If it fails, we may at least doubt whether
it solves the one isolated case of the Great Bear among
the Greeks and Romans. It must be observed that
the philological explanation of Mr. M&uuml;ller does not
clear up the Arcadian story of their own descent from a
she-bear who is now a star. Yet similar stories of the
descent of tribes from animals are so widespread that
it would be difficult to name the race or the quarter of
the globe where they are not found. Are they all derived
from misunderstood words meaning &lsquo;bright&rsquo;?
These considerations appear to be a strong argument
for comparing not only Aryan, but all attainable myths.
We shall often find, if we take a wide view, that the philological
explanation which seemed plausible in a single
case is hopelessly narrow when applied to a large collection
of parallel cases in language of various families.</p>

<p>Finally, in dealing with star-myths, we adhere to
the hypothesis of Mr. Tylor: &lsquo;From savagery up
to civilisation,&rsquo; Akkadian, Greek, or English, &lsquo;there
may be traced in the mythology of the stars a course
of thought, changed, indeed, in application, yet never
broken in its evident connection from first to last.
The savage sees individual stars as animate beings, or
combines star-groups into living celestial creatures, or
limbs of them, or objects connected with them; while
at the other extremity of the scale of civilisation the
modern astronomer keeps up just such ancient fancies,
turning them to account in useful survival, as a means
of mapping out the celestial globe.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>&lsquo;I have found out a new cure for rheumatism,&rsquo; said
the lady beside whom it was my privilege to sit at
dinner. &lsquo;You carry a potato about in your pocket!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Some one has written an amusing account of the
behaviour of a man who is finishing a book. He
takes his ideas everywhere with him and broods over
them, even at dinner, in the pauses of conversation.
But here was a lady who kindly contributed to my
studies and offered me folklore and survivals in cultivated
Kensington.</p>

<p>My mind had strayed from the potato cure to the
New Zealand habit of carrying a baked yam at night
to frighten away ghosts, and to the old English belief
that a bit of bread kept in the pocket was sovereign
against evil spirits. Why should ghosts dread the
food of mortals when it is the custom of most races
of mortals to feed ancestral ghosts? The human
mind works pretty rapidly, and all this had passed
through my brain while I replied, in tones of curiosity:
&lsquo;A potato!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes; but it is not every potato that will do. I
heard of the cure in the country, and when we came
up to town, and my husband was complaining of
rheumatism, I told one of the servants to get me a
potato for Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s rheumatism. &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
said the man; &ldquo;but it must be a <em>stolen</em> potato.&rdquo; I
had forgotten that. Well, one can&rsquo;t ask one&rsquo;s servants
to steal potatoes. It is easy in the country, where
you can pick one out of anybody&rsquo;s field.&rsquo; &lsquo;And what
did you do?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;Oh, I drove to Covent
Garden and ordered a lot of fruit and flowers.
While the man was not looking, I stole a potato&mdash;a
very little one. I don&rsquo;t think there was any harm in
it.&rsquo; &lsquo;And did Mr. Johnson try the potato cure?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yes, he carried it in his pocket, and now he is quite
well. I told the doctor, and he says he knows of the
cure, but he dares not recommend it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>How oddly superstitions survive! The central
idea of this modern folly about the potato is that you
must pilfer the root. Let us work the idea of the
healing of magical herb backwards, from Kensington
to European folklore, and thence to classical times,
to Homer, and to the Hottentots. Turning first to
Germany, we note the beliefs, not about the potato,
but about another vegetable, the mandrake. Of all
roots, in German superstition, the Alraun, or mandrake
is the most famous. The herb was conceived
of, in the savage fashion, as a living human person, a
kind of old witch-wife.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>Again, the root has a human shape. &lsquo;If a hereditary
thief who has preserved his chastity gets hung,&rsquo;
the broad-leafed, yellow-flowered mandrake grows
up, in his likeness, beneath the gallows from which
he is suspended. The mandrake, like the moly, the
magical herb of the Odyssey, is &lsquo;hard for men to
dig.&rsquo; He who desires to possess a mandrake must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
stop his ears with wax, so that he may not hear
the deathly yells which the plant utters as it is
being dragged out of the earth. Then before sunrise
on a Friday, the amateur goes out with a dog,
&lsquo;all black,&rsquo; makes three crosses round the mandrake,
loosens the soil about the root, ties the root to the
dog&rsquo;s tail, and offers the beast a piece of bread. The
dog runs at the bread, drags out the mandrake root,
and falls dead, killed by the horrible yell of the plant.
The root is now taken up, washed with wine, wrapped
in silk, laid in a casket, bathed every Friday, &lsquo;and
clothed in a little new white smock every new moon.&rsquo;
The mandrake acts, if thus considerately treated, as
a kind of familiar spirit. &lsquo;Every piece of coin put
to her over night is found doubled in the morning.&rsquo;
Gipsy folklore, and the folklore of American children,
keep this belief in doubling deposits. The gipsies
use the notion in what they call &lsquo;The Great Trick.&rsquo;
Some foolish rustic makes up his money in a parcel
which he gives to the gipsy. The latter, after various
ceremonies performed, returns the parcel, which is to
be buried. The money will be found doubled by a
certain date. Of course when the owner unburies the
parcel he finds nothing in it but brass buttons. In
the same way, and with pious confidence, the American
boy buries a marble in a hollow log, uttering the formula,
&lsquo;What hasn&rsquo;t come here, <em>come!</em> what&rsquo;s here,
<em>stay</em> here!&rsquo; and expects to find all the marbles he
has ever lost.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Let us follow the belief in magical
roots into the old Pagan world.</p>

<p>The ancients knew mandragora and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
superstitions connected with it very well. Dioscorides
mentions <i>mandragorus</i>, or <i>antimelon</i>, or <i>dirc&aelig;a</i>, or
<i>Circ&aelig;a</i>, and says the Egyptians call it <i>apemoum</i>, and
Pythagoras &lsquo;anthropomorphon.&rsquo; In digging the root,
Pliny says &lsquo;there are some ceremonies observed, first
they that goe about this worke, look especially to this
that the wind be not in their face, but blow upon their
backs. Then with the point of a sword they draw
three circles round about the plant, which don, they
dig it up afterwards with their face unto the west.&rsquo;
Pliny says nothing of the fetich qualities of the plant,
as credited in modern and medi&aelig;val Germany, but
mentions &lsquo;sufficient it is with some bodies to cast them
into sleep with the smel of mandrago.&rsquo; This is like
Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;poppy and mandragora, and all the
drowsy syrups of the world.&rsquo; Plato and Demosthenes<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
also speak of mandragora as a soporific. It
is more to the purpose of magic that Columella mentions
&lsquo;the <em>half-human</em> mandragora.&rsquo; Here we touch
the origin of the mandrake superstitions. The roots
have a kind of fantastic resemblance to the human
shape; Pliny describes them as being &lsquo;of a fleshy
substance and tender.&rsquo; Now it is one of the recognised
principles in magic, that things like each other,
however superficially, affect each other in a mystic
way, and possess identical properties. Thus, in
Melanesia, according to Mr. Codrington,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> &lsquo;a stone
in the shape of a pig, of a bread-fruit, of a yam,
was a most valuable find,&rsquo; because it made pigs
prolific, and fertilised bread-fruit trees and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
yam-plots. In Scotland, too, &lsquo;stones were called by the
names of the limbs they resembled, as &ldquo;eye-stane,&rdquo;
&ldquo;head-stane.&rdquo; A patient washed the affected part
of his body, and rubbed it well with the stone corresponding.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
In precisely the same way, the mandrake
root, being thought to resemble the human body,
was credited with human and superhuman powers.
Josephus mentions<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> a plant &lsquo;not easily caught, which
slips away from them that wish to gather it, and
never stands still&rsquo; till certain repulsive rites are performed.
These rites cannot well be reported here,
but they are quite familiar to Red Indian and to
Bushman magic. Another way to dig the plant
spoken of by Josephus is by aid of the dog, as in the
German superstition quoted from Grimm. &AElig;lian also
recommends the use of the dog to pluck the herb
aglaophotis, which shines at night.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> When the dog
has dragged up the root, and died of terror, his body
is to be buried on the spot with religious honours
and secret sacred rites.</p>

<p>So much for mandragora, which, like the healing
potato, has to be acquired stealthily and with peril.
Now let us examine the Homeric herb moly. The
plant is thus introduced by Homer: In the tenth
book of the <i>Odyssey</i>, Circe has turned Odysseus&rsquo;s
men into swine. He sets forth to rescue them, trusting
only to his sword. The god Hermes meets him,
and offers him &lsquo;a charmed herb,&rsquo; &lsquo;this herb of grace&rsquo;
(<ins class="greek" title="pharmakon esthlon">&#966;&#8049;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#952;&#955;&#8057;&#957;</ins>), whereby he may subdue the magic
wiles of Circe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
The plant is described by Homer with some
minuteness. &lsquo;It was black at the root, but the flower
was like to milk. &ldquo;Moly,&rdquo; the gods call it, but it is
hard for mortal men to dig, howbeit with the gods all
things are possible.&rsquo; The etymologies given of &lsquo;moly&rsquo;
are almost as numerous as the etymologists. One
derivation, from the old &lsquo;Turanian&rsquo; tongue of Accadia,
will be examined later. The Scholiast offers the
derivation &lsquo;<ins class="greek" title="m&ocirc;lyein">&#956;&#969;&#955;&#8059;&#949;&#953;&#957;</ins>, to make charms of no avail&rsquo;; but
this is exactly like Professor Blackie&rsquo;s etymological
discovery that Erinys is derived from <ins class="greek" title="erinyein">&#7952;&#961;&#953;&#957;&#8058;&#949;&#953;&#957;</ins>: &lsquo;he
might as well derive <em>critic</em> from <em>criticise</em>.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The
Scholiast adds that moly caused death to the person
who dragged it out of the ground. This identification
of moly with mandrake is probably based on Homer&rsquo;s
remark that moly is &lsquo;hard to dig.&rsquo; The black root
and white flower of moly are quite unlike the yellow
flower and white fleshy root ascribed by Pliny to
mandrake. Only confusion is caused by regarding
the two magical herbs as identical.</p>

<p>But why are any herbs or roots magical? While
some Scholars, like De Gubernatis, seek an explanation
in supposed myths about clouds and stars, it is enough
for our purpose to observe that herbs really have medicinal
properties, and that untutored people invariably
confound medicine with magic. A plant or root is
thought to possess virtue, not only when swallowed
in powder or decoction, but when carried in the
hand. St. John&rsquo;s wort and rowan berries, like the
Homeric moly, still &lsquo;make evil charms of none avail&rsquo;;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>says the Scotch rhyme. Any fanciful resemblance of
leaf or flower or root to a portion of the human body,
any analogy based on colour, will give a plant reputation
for magical virtues. This habit of mind survives
from the savage condition. The Hottentots are great
herbalists. Like the Greeks, like the Germans, they
expect supernatural aid from plants and roots. Mr.
Hahn, in his <i>Tsui Goam, the Supreme Being of the
Khoi Khoi</i> (p. 82), gives the following examples:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Dapper, in his description of Africa, p. 621, tells us:
&lsquo;Some of them wear round the neck, roots, which they find
far inland, in rivers, and being on a journey they light them
in a fire or chew them, if they must sleep the night out in
the field. They believe that these roots keep off the wild
animals. The roots they chew are spit out around the spot
where they encamp for the night; and in a similar way, if
they set the roots alight, they blow the smoke and ashes
about, believing that the smell will keep the wild animals
off.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I had often occasion to observe the practice of these
superstitious ceremonies, especially when we were in a part
of the country where we heard the roaring of the lions, or
had the day previously met with the footprints of the king
of the beasts.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Korannas also have these roots as safeguards with
them. If a Commando (a warlike expedition) goes out,
every man will put such roots in his pockets and in the
pouch where he keeps his bullets, believing that the arrows
or bullets of the enemy have no effect, but that his own
bullets will surely kill the enemy. And also before they lie
down to sleep, they set these roots alight, and murmur:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
&ldquo;My grandfather&rsquo;s root, bring sleep on the eyes of the lion
and leopard and the hyena. Make them blind, that they
cannot find us, and cover their noses, that they cannot smell
us out.&rdquo; Also, if they have carried off large booty, or
stolen cattle of the enemy, they light these roots and say:
&ldquo;We thank thee, our grandfather&rsquo;s root, that thou hast
given us cattle to eat. Let the enemy sleep, and lead him
on the wrong track, that he may not follow us until we have
safely escaped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Another sort of shrub is called <i>&#257;bib</i>. Herdsmen, especially,
carry pieces of its wood as charms, and if cattle or
sheep have gone astray, they burn a piece of it in the fire,
that the wild animals may not destroy them. And they
believe that the cattle remain safe until they can be found
the next morning.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Schweinfurth found the same belief in magic
herbs and roots among the Bongoes and Niam Niams
in &lsquo;The Heart of Africa.&rsquo; The Bongoes believe,
like the Homeric Greeks, that &lsquo;certain roots ward off
the evil influences of spirits.&rsquo; Like the German
amateurs of the mandrake, they assert that &lsquo;there
is no other resource for obtaining communication
with spirits, except by means of certain roots&rsquo; (i. 306).</p>

<p>Our position is that the English magical potato,
the German mandrake, the Greek moly, are all survivals
from a condition of mind like that in which
the Hottentots still pray to roots.</p>

<p>Now that we have brought mandragora and moly
into connection with the ordinary magical superstitions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
of savage peoples, let us see what is made of
the subject by another method. Mr. R. Brown, the
learned and industrious author of <i>The Great Dionysiak
Myth</i>, has investigated the traditions about the
Homeric moly. He first<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> &lsquo;turns to Aryan philology.&rsquo;
Many guesses at the etymology of &lsquo;moly&rsquo; have been
made. Curtius suggests <i>mollis</i>, <i>molvis</i>, <ins class="greek" title="m&ocirc;ly-s">&#956;&#8182;&#955;&#965;-&#962;</ins>, akin to
<ins class="greek" title="malakos">&#956;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#8056;&#962;</ins>, &lsquo;soft.&rsquo; This does not suit Mr. Brown, who,
to begin with, is persuaded that the herb is not a
magical herb, <i>sans phrase</i>, like those which the Hottentots
use, but that the basis of the myth &lsquo;is simply
the effect of night upon the world of day.&rsquo; Now, as
moly is a name in use among the gods, Mr. Brown
thinks &lsquo;we may fairly examine the hypothesis of a
foreign origin of the term.&rsquo; Any one who holds that
certain Greek gods were borrowed from abroad, may
be allowed to believe that the gods used foreign words,
and, as Mr. Brown points out, there are foreign elements
in various Homeric names of imported articles,
peoples, persons, and so forth. Where, then, is a
foreign word like moly, which might have reached
Homer? By a long process of research, Mr. Brown
finds his word in ancient &lsquo;Akkadian.&rsquo; From Professor
Sayce he borrows a reference to Apuleius Barbarus,
about whose life nothing is known, and whose date
is vague. Apuleius Barbarus may have lived about
four centuries after our era, and <em>he</em> says that &lsquo;wild
rue was called moly by the Cappadocians.&rsquo; Rue,
like rosemary, and indeed like most herbs, has its
magical repute, and if we supposed that Homer&rsquo;s
moly was rue, there would be some interest in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
knowledge. Rue was called &lsquo;herb of grace&rsquo; in
English, holy water was sprinkled with it, and the
name is a translation of Homer&rsquo;s <ins class="greek" title="pharmakon esthlon">&#966;&#8049;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#952;&#955;&#8057;&#957;</ins>.
Perhaps rue was used in sprinkling, because in
pre-Christian times rue had, by itself, power against
sprites and powers of evil. Our ancestors may have
thought it as well to combine the old charm of rue
and the new Christian potency of holy water. Thus
there would be a distinct analogy between Homeric
moly and English &lsquo;herb of grace.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Euphrasy and rue&rsquo; were employed to purge and
purify mortal eyes. Pliny is very learned about the
magical virtues of rue. Just as the stolen potato is
sovereign for rheumatism, so &lsquo;rue stolen thriveth the
best.&rsquo; The Samoans think that their most valued
vegetables were stolen from heaven by a Samoan
visitor.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> It is remarkable that rue, according to
Pliny, is killed by the touch of a woman in the same
way as, according to Josephus, the mandrake is
tamed.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> These passages prove that the classical
peoples had the same extraordinary superstitions
about women as the Bushmen and Red Indians.
Indeed Pliny<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> describes a magical manner of defending
the crops from blight, by aid of women, which
is actually practised in America by the Red Men.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, are proofs enough that rue was magical
outside of Cappadocia. But this is not an argument
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
on Mr. Brown&rsquo;s lines. The Cappadocians called rue
&lsquo;moly&rsquo;; what language, he asks, was spoken by the
Cappadocians? Prof. Sayce (who knows so many
tongues) says that &lsquo;we know next to nothing of the
language of the Cappadocians, or of the Moschi who
lived in the same locality.&rsquo; But where Prof. Sayce is,
the Hittites, if we may say so respectfully, are not
very far off. In this case he thinks the Moschi
(though he admits we know next to nothing about
it) &lsquo;seem to have spoken a language allied to that of
the Cappadocians and Hittites.&rsquo; That is to say, it
is not impossible that the language of the Moschi,
about which next to nothing is known, may have
been allied to that of the Cappadocians, about
which we know next to nothing. All that we do
know in this case is, that four hundred years after
Christ the dwellers in Cappadocia employed a word
&lsquo;moly,&rsquo; which had been Greek for at least twelve
hundred years. But Mr. Brown goes on to quote
that one of the languages of which we know next
to nothing, Hittite, was &lsquo;probably allied to Proto-Armenian,
and perhaps Lykian, and was above all
not Semitic.&rsquo; In any case &lsquo;the cuneiform mode of
writing was used in Cappadocia at an early period.&rsquo;
As even Professor Sayce declines to give more than
a tentative reading of a Cappadocian cuneiform inscription,
it seems highly rash to seek in this direction
for an interpretation of a Homeric word &lsquo;moly,&rsquo;
used in Cappadocia very many centuries after the
tablets were scratched. But, on the evidence of the
Babylonian character of the cuneiform writing on
Cappadocian tablets, Mr. Brown establishes a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
connection between the people of Accadia (who probably
introduced the cuneiform style) and the people of
Cappadocia. The connection amounts to this. Twelve
hundred years after Homer, the inhabitants of Cappadocia
are said to have called rue &lsquo;moly.&rsquo; At some
unknown period, the Accadians appear to have influenced
the art of writing in Cappadocia. Apparently
Mr. Brown thinks it not too rash to infer
that the Cappadocian use of the word &lsquo;moly&rsquo; is
not derived from the Greeks, but from the Accadians.
Now in Accadian, according to Mr. Brown,
<i>mul</i> means &lsquo;star.&rsquo; &lsquo;Hence <i>ulu</i> or <i>mulu</i> = <ins class="greek" title="m&ocirc;ly">&#956;&#8182;&#955;&#965;</ins>, the
mysterious Homerik counter-charm to the charms of
Kirk&ecirc;&rsquo; (p. 60). Mr. Brown&rsquo;s theory, therefore, is that
moly originally meant &lsquo;star.&rsquo; Circe is the moon,
Odysseus is the sun, and &lsquo;what <em>watches over</em> the solar
hero at night when exposed to the hostile lunar
power, but the stars?&rsquo; especially the dog-star.</p>

<p>The truth is, that Homer&rsquo;s moly, whatever plant
he meant by the name, is only one of the magical
herbs in which most peoples believe or have believed.
Like the Scottish rowan, or like St. John&rsquo;s wort, it is
potent against evil influences. People have their own
simple reasons for believing in these plants, and have
not needed to bring down their humble, early botany
from the clouds and stars. We have to imagine, on
the other hand (if we follow Mr. Brown), that in some
unknown past the Cappadocians turned the Accadian
word for a star into a local name of a plant, that
this word reached Homer, that the supposed old
Accadian myth of the star which watches over the
solar hero retained its vitality in Greek, and leaving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
the star clung to the herb, that Homer used an
&lsquo;Akkado-Kappadokian&rsquo; myth, and that, many ages
after, the Accadian star-name in its perverted sense
of &lsquo;rue&rsquo; survived in Cappadocia. This structure of
argument is based on tablets which even Prof. Sayce
cannot read, and on possibilities about the alliances
of tongues concerning which we &lsquo;know next to
nothing.&rsquo; A method which leaves on one side the
common, natural, widely-diffused beliefs about the
magic virtue of herbs (beliefs which we have seen at
work in Kensington and in Central Africa), to hunt for
moly among stars and undeciphered Kappadokian
inscriptions, seems a dubious method. We have examined
it at full length because it is a specimen of an
erudite, but, as we think, a mistaken way in folklore.
M. Hal&eacute;vy&rsquo;s warnings against the shifting mythical
theories based on sciences so new as the lore of
Assyria and &lsquo;Akkadia&rsquo; are by no means superfluous.
&lsquo;Akkadian&rsquo; is rapidly become as ready a key to all
locks as &lsquo;Aryan&rsquo; was a few years ago.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<h2><a name="chap09" id="chap09"></a><i>&lsquo;KALEVALA&rsquo;; OR, THE FINNISH
NATIONAL EPIC.</i></h2>


<p>It is difficult to account for the fact that the scientific
curiosity which is just now so busy in examining
all the monuments of the primitive condition of our
race, should, in England at least, have almost totally
neglected to popularise the &lsquo;Kalevala,&rsquo; or national
poem of the Finns. Besides its fresh and simple beauty
of style, its worth as a storehouse of every kind of
primitive folklore, being as it is the production of an
<i>Urvolk</i>, a nation that has undergone no violent revolution
in language or institutions&mdash;the &lsquo;Kalevala&rsquo; has
the peculiar interest of occupying a position between
the two kinds of primitive poetry, the ballad and
the epic. So much difficulty has been introduced
into the study of the first developments of song, by
confusing these distinct sorts of composition under
the name of popular poetry, that it may be well, in
writing of a poem which occupies a middle place
between epic and ballad, to define what we mean by
each.</p>

<p>The author of our old English <i>Art of Poesie</i>
begins his work with a statement which may serve as
a text: &lsquo;Poesie,&rsquo; says Puttenham, writing in 1589,
&lsquo;is more ancient than the <i>artificiall</i> of the Greeks and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
Latines, coming by instinct of nature, and used by
the savage and uncivill, who were before all science
and civilitie. This is proved by certificate of merchants
and travellers, who by late navigations have
surveyed the whole world, and discovered large countries,
and strange people, wild and savage, affirming
that the American, the Perusine, and the very canniball,
do sing, and also say, their highest and holiest
matters in certain riming versicles.&rsquo; Puttenham is
here referring to that instinct of primitive men, which
compels them in all moments of high-wrought feeling,
and on all solemn occasions, to give utterance
to a kind of chant.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Such a chant is the song of
Lamech, when he had &lsquo;slain a man to his wounding.&rsquo;
So in the Norse sagas, Grettir and Gunnar
<em>sing</em> when they have anything particular to say;
and so in the <i>M&auml;rchen</i>&mdash;the primitive fairy tales of
all nations&mdash;scraps of verse are introduced where emphasis
is wanted. This craving for passionate expression
takes a more formal shape in the lays which
among all primitive peoples, as among the modern
Greeks to-day,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> are sung at betrothals, funerals, and
departures for distant lands. These songs have been
collected in Scotland by Scott and Motherwell;
their Danish counterparts have been translated by
Mr. Prior. In Greece, M. Fauriel and Dr. Ulrichs;
in Provence, Damase Arbaud; in Italy, M. Nigra;
in Servia, Talvj; in France, G&eacute;rard de Nerval&mdash;have
done for their separate countries what Scott did for
the Border. Professor Child, of Harvard, is publishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
a beautiful critical collection of English <i>Volkslieder</i>,
with all known variants from every country.</p>

<p>A comparison of the collections proves that
among all European lands the primitive &lsquo;versicles&rsquo;
of the people are identical in tone, form, and incident.
It is this kind of early expression of a people&rsquo;s life&mdash;careless,
abrupt, brief, as was necessitated by the fact
that they were sung to the accompaniment of the
dance&mdash;that we call ballads. These are distinctly,
and in every sense, popular poems, and nothing can
cause greater confusion than to apply the same title,
&lsquo;popular,&rsquo; to early epic poetry. Ballads are short;
a long ballad, as Mr. Matthew Arnold has said,
creeps and halts. A true epic, on the other hand,
is long, and its tone is grand, noble, and sustained.
Ballads are not artistic; while the form of the epic,
whether we take the hexameter or the rougher <i>laisse</i>
of the French <i>chansons de geste</i>, is full of conscious
and admirable art. Lastly, popular ballads deal
with vague characters, acting and living in vague
places; while the characters of an epic are heroes of
definite station, <em>whose descendants are still in the land</em>,
whose home is a recognisable place, Ithaca, or Argos.
Now, though these two kinds of early poetry&mdash;the
ballad, the song of the people; the epic, the song of
the chiefs of the people, of the ruling race&mdash;are
distinct in kind, it does not follow that they have
no connection, that the nobler may not have been
developed out of the materials of the lower form of
expression. And the value of the &lsquo;Kalevala&rsquo; is
partly this, that it combines the continuity and unison
of the epic with the simplicity and popularity of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
ballad, and so forms a kind of link in the history of
the development of poetry. This may become clearer
as we proceed to explain the literary history of the
Finnish national poem.</p>

<p>Sixty years ago, it may be said, no one was aware
that Finland possessed a national poem at all. Her
people&mdash;who claim affinity with the Magyars of
Hungary, but are possibly a back-wave of an earlier
tide of population&mdash;had remained untouched by
foreign influences since their conquest by Sweden,
and their somewhat lax and wholesale conversion
to Christianity: events which took place gradually
between the middle of the twelfth and the end of the
thirteenth centuries. Under the rule of Sweden, the
Finns were left to their quiet life and undisturbed
imaginings, among the forests and lakes of the region
which they aptly called Pohja, &lsquo;the ends of things&rsquo;;
while their educated classes took no very keen interest
in the native poetry and mythology of their
race. At length the annexation of Finland by Russia,
in 1809, awakened national feeling, and stimulated
research into songs and customs which were the
heirlooms of the people.</p>

<p>It was the policy of Russia to encourage, rather
than to check, this return on a distant past; and
from the north of Norway to the slopes of the Altai,
ardent explorers sought out the fragments of unwritten
early poetry. These runes, or <i>Runots</i>, were
chiefly sung by old men called <i>Runoias</i>, to beguile the
weariness of the long dark winters. The custom was
for two champions to engage in a contest of memory,
clasping each other&rsquo;s hands, and reciting in turn till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
he whose memory first gave in slackened his hold.
The &lsquo;Kalevala&rsquo; contains an instance of this practice,
where it is said that no one was so hardy as to
clasp hands with W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen, who is at once the
Orpheus and the Prometheus of Finnish mythology.
These Runoias, or rhapsodists, complain, of course,
of the degeneracy of human memory; they notice
how any foreign influence, in religion or politics, is
destructive to the native songs of a race.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> &lsquo;As for
the lays of old time, a thousand have been scattered
to the wind, a thousand buried in the snow; ...
as for those which the Munks (the Teutonic knights)
swept away and the prayer of the priests overwhelmed,
a thousand tongues were not able to recount them.&rsquo;
In spite of the losses thus caused, and in spite of the
suspicious character of the Finns, which often made
the task of collection a dangerous one, enough materials
remained to furnish Dr. L&ouml;nnrot, the most noted
explorer, with thirty-five <i>Runots</i>, or cantos. These
were published in 1835, but later research produced
the fifteen cantos which make up the symmetrical fifty
of the &lsquo;Kalevala.&rsquo; In the task of arranging and
uniting these, Dr. L&ouml;nnrot played the part traditionally
ascribed to the commission of Pisistratus in
relation to the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>. Dr. L&ouml;nnrot
cut about and altered at pleasure the materials
which come before us as one poem. They have
little unity now, and originally had none.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
It cannot be doubted that, at whatever period
the Homeric poems took shape in Greece, they
were believed to record the feats of the supposed
ancestors of existing families. Thus, for example,
Pisistratus, as a descendant of the Nelid&aelig;, had
an interest in securing certain parts, at least, of
the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i> from oblivion. The
same family pride embellished and preserved the
epic poetry of early France. There were in France
but three heroic houses, or <i>gestes</i>; and three corresponding
cycles of <i>&eacute;pop&eacute;es</i>. Now, in the &lsquo;Kalevala,&rsquo;
there is no trace of the influence of family
feeling; it was no one&rsquo;s peculiar care and pride
to watch over the records of the fame of this or
that hero. The poem begins with a cosmogony
as wild as any Indian dream of creation; and the
human characters who move in the story are
shadowy inhabitants of no very definite lands,
whom no family claim as their forefathers. The
very want of this idea of family and aristocratic
pride gives the &lsquo;Kalevala&rsquo; a unique place among
epics. It is emphatically an epic of the people,
of that class whose life contains no element of
progress, no break in continuity; which from age
to age preserves, in solitude and close communion
with nature, the earliest beliefs of grey antiquity.
The Greek epic, on the other hand, has, as
Preller<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> points out, &lsquo;nothing to do with natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
man, but with an ideal world of heroes, with
sons of the gods, with consecrated kings, heroes,
elders, <em>a kind of specific race of men</em>. The people
exist only as subsidiary to the great houses, as a
mere background against which stand out the
shining figures of heroes; as a race of beings fresh
and rough from the hands of nature, with whom,
and with whose concerns, the great houses and
their bards have little concern.&rsquo; This feeling&mdash;so
universal in Greece, and in the feudal countries of
medi&aelig;val Europe, that there are two kinds of men,
the golden and the brazen race, as Plato would have
called them&mdash;is absent, with all its results, in the
&lsquo;Kalevala.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Among the Finns we find no trace of an aristocracy;
there is scarcely a mention of kings, or
priests; the heroes of the poem are really popular
heroes, fishers, smiths, husbandmen, &lsquo;medicine-men,&rsquo;
or wizards; exaggerated shadows of the people,
pursuing on a heroic scale, not war, but the common
daily business of primitive and peaceful men. In
recording their adventures, the &lsquo;Kalevala,&rsquo; like the
shield of Achilles, reflects all the life of a race, the
feasts, the funerals, the rites of seed-time and harvest,
of marriage and death, the hymn, and the
magical incantation.</p>

<p>Though without the interest of an unique position
as a popular epic, the &lsquo;Kalevala&rsquo; is very valuable,
both for its literary beauties and for the confused
mass of folklore which it contains.</p>

<p>Here old cosmogonies, attempts of man to represent
to himself the beginning of things, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
mingled with the same wild imaginings as are found
everywhere in the shape of fairy-tales. We are
hurried from an account of the mystic egg of creation,
to a hymn like that of the Ambarval Brothers,
to a strangely familiar scrap of a nursery story, to
an incident which we remember as occurring in
almost identical words in a Scotch ballad. We
are among a people which endows everything with
human characters and life, which is in familiar
relations with birds, and beasts, and even with
rocks and plants. Ravens and wolves and fishes
of the sea, sun, moon, and stars, are kindly or
churlish; drops of blood find speech, man and
maid change to snake or swan and resume their
forms, ships have magic powers, like the ships of
the Ph&aelig;acians.</p>

<p>Then there is the oddest confusion of every stage
of religious development: we find a supreme God,
delighting in righteousness; Ukko, the lord of the
vault of air, who stands apart from men, and sends
his son, W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen, to be their teacher in music
and agriculture.</p>

<p>Across this faith comes a religion of petrified
abstractions like those of the Roman Pantheon.
There are gods of colour, a goddess of weaving, a
goddess of man&rsquo;s blood, besides elemental spirits
of woods and waters, and the <i>manes</i> of the dead.
Meanwhile the working faith of the people is the
belief in magic&mdash;generally a sign of the lower
culture. It is supposed that the knowledge of
certain magic words gives power over the elemental
bodies which obey them; it is held that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
the will of a distant sorcerer can cross the lakes
and plains like the breath of a fantastic frost,
with power to change an enemy to ice or stone.
Traces remain of the worship of animals: there
is a hymn to the bear; a dance like the bear-dance
of the American Indians; and another
hymn tells of the birth and power of the serpent.
Across all, and closing all, comes a hostile account
of the origin of Christianity&mdash;the end of joy and
music.</p>

<p>How primitive was the condition of the authors
of this medley of beliefs is best proved by the survival
of the custom called exogamy.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> This custom,
which is not peculiar to the Finns, but is probably
a universal note of early society, prohibits marriage
between members of the same tribe. Consequently,
the main action, such as it is, of the &lsquo;Kalevala&rsquo;
turns on the efforts made by the men of
Kaleva to obtain brides from the hostile tribe of
Pohja.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>Further proof of ancient origin is to be found in
what is the great literary beauty of the poem&mdash;its
pure spontaneity and simplicity. It is the production
of an intensely imaginative race, to which song
came as the most natural expression of joy and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
sorrow, terror or triumph&mdash;a class which lay near to
nature&rsquo;s secret, and was not out of sympathy with
the wild kin of woods and waters.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;These songs,&rsquo; says the prelude, &lsquo;were found by the
wayside, and gathered in the depths of the copses; blown
from the branches of the forest, and culled among the
plumes of the pine-trees. These lays came to me as I
followed the flocks, in a land of meadows honey-sweet and
of golden hills.... The cold has spoken to me, and the
rain has told me her runes; the winds of heaven, the
waves of the sea, have spoken and sung to me; the wild
birds have taught me, the music of many waters has been
my master.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The metre in which the epic is chanted resembles,
to an English ear, that of Mr. Longfellow&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Hiawatha&rsquo;&mdash;there is assonance rather than rhyme;
and a very musical effect is produced by the liquid
character of the language, and by the frequent
alliterations.</p>

<p>This rough outline of the main characteristics of
the &lsquo;Kalevala&rsquo; we shall now try to fill up with an
abstract of its contents. The poem is longer than
the <i>Iliad</i>, and much of interest must necessarily be
omitted; but it is only through such an abstract that
any idea can be given of the sort of unity which does
prevail amid the most utter discrepancy.</p>

<p>In the first place, what is to be understood by the
word &lsquo;Kalevala&rsquo;? The affix <i>la</i> signifies &lsquo;abode.&rsquo;
Thus, &lsquo;Tuonela&rsquo; is &lsquo;the abode of Tuoni,&rsquo; the god of
the lower world; and as &lsquo;kaleva&rsquo; means &lsquo;heroic,&rsquo;
&lsquo;magnificent,&rsquo; &lsquo;Kalevala&rsquo; is &lsquo;The Home of Heroes.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
The poem is the record of the adventures of the
people of Kalevala&mdash;of their strife with the men
of Pohjola, the place of the world&rsquo;s end. We may
fancy two old Runoias, or singers, clasping hands
on one of the first nights of the Finnish winter,
and beginning (what probably has never been
accomplished) the attempt to work through the
&lsquo;Kalevala&rsquo; before the return of summer. They
commence <i>ab ovo</i>, or, rather, before the egg.
First is chanted the birth of W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen, the
benefactor and teacher of men. He is the son
of Luonnotar, the daughter of Nature, who answers
to the first woman of the Iroquois cosmogony. Beneath
the breath and touch of wind and tide, she
conceived a child; but nine ages of man passed
before his birth, while the mother floated on
&lsquo;the formless and the multiform waters.&rsquo; Then
Ukko, the supreme God, sent an eagle, which
laid her eggs in the maiden&rsquo;s bosom, and from
these eggs grew earth and sky, sun and moon,
star and cloud. Then was W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen born on
the waters, and reached a barren land, and gazed
on the new heavens and the new earth. There
he sowed the grain that is the bread of man,
chanting the hymn used at seed-time, calling on
the mother earth to make the green herb spring,
and on Ukko to send down clouds and rain. So
the corn sprang, and the golden cuckoo&mdash;which in
Finland plays the part of the popinjay in Scotch
ballads, or of the three golden birds in Greek folk-songs&mdash;came
with his congratulations. In regard to
the epithet &lsquo;golden,&rsquo; it may be observed that gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
and silver, in the Finnish epic, are lavished on the
commonest objects of daily life.</p>

<p>This is a universal note of primitive poetry, and
is not a peculiar Finnish idiom, as M. Leouzon le
Duc supposes; nor, as Mr. Tozer seems to think, in
his account of Romaic ballads, a trace of Oriental influence
among the modern Greeks. It is common to
all the ballads of Europe, as M. Amp&egrave;re has pointed
out, and may be observed in the &lsquo;Chanson de
Roland,&rsquo; and in Homer.</p>

<p>While the corn ripened, W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen rested from
his labours, and took the task of Orpheus. &lsquo;He sang,&rsquo;
says the &lsquo;Kalevala,&rsquo; of the origin of things, of the
mysteries hidden from babes, that none may attain to
in this sad life, in the hours of these perishable days.
The fame of the Runoia&rsquo;s singing excited jealousy in
the breast of one of the men around him, of whose
origin the &lsquo;Kalevala&rsquo; gives no account. This man,
Joukahainen, provoked him to a trial of song, boasting,
like Empedocles, or like one of the old Celtic
bards, that he had been all things. &lsquo;When the earth
was made I was there; when space was unrolled I
launched the sun on his way.&rsquo; Then was W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen
wroth, and by the force of his enchantment he
rooted Joukahainen to the ground, and suffered him
not to go free without promising him the hand of his
sister Aino. The mother was delighted; but the girl
wept that she must now cover her long locks, her
curls, her glory, and be the wife of &lsquo;the old imperturbable
W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen.&rsquo; It is in vain that her mother
offers her dainty food and rich dresses; she flees
from home, and wanders till she meets three maidens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
bathing, and joins them, and is drowned, singing a
sad song: &lsquo;Ah, never may my sister come to bathe
in the sea-water, for the drops of the sea are the
drops of my blood.&rsquo; This wild idea occurs in the
Romaic ballad, <ins class="greek" title="h&ecirc; kor&ecirc; taxideutria">&#7969; &#954;&#8057;&#961;&#951; &#964;&#945;&#958;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#8059;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#945;</ins>, where a drop of
blood on the lips of the drowned girl tinges all the
waters of the world. To return to the fate of Aino.
A swift hare runs (as in the Zulu legend of the
Origin of Death) with the tale of sorrow to the
maiden&rsquo;s mother, and from the mother&rsquo;s tears flow
rivers of water, and therein are isles with golden hills
where golden birds make melody. As for the old,
the imperturbable Runoia, he loses his claim to the
latter title, he is filled with sorrow, and searches
through all the elements for his lost bride. At length
he catches a fish which is unknown to him, who, like
Atlas, &lsquo;knew the depths of all the seas.&rsquo; The strange
fish slips from his hands, a &lsquo;tress of hair, of drowned
maiden&rsquo;s hair,&rsquo; floats for a moment on the foam, and
too late he recognises that &lsquo;there was never salmon
yet that shone so fair, above the nets at sea.&rsquo; His
lost bride has been within his reach, and now is
doubly lost to him. Suddenly the waves are cloven
asunder, and the mother of Nature and of W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen
appears, to comfort her son, like Thetis from
the deep. She bids him go and seek, in the land of
Pohjola, a bride alien to his race. After many a wild
adventure, W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen reaches Pohjola and is
kindly entreated by Loutri, the mother of the maiden
of the land. But he grows homesick, and complains,
almost in Dante&rsquo;s words, of the bitter bread of exile.
Loutri will only grant him her daughter&rsquo;s hand on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
condition that he gives her a <i>sampo</i>. A sampo is a
mysterious engine that grinds meal, salt, and money.
In fact, it is the mill in the well-known fairy tale,
<i>Why the Sea is Salt</i>.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen cannot fashion this mill himself, he
must seek aid at home from Ilmarinen, the smith who
forged &lsquo;the iron vault of hollow heaven.&rsquo; As the
hero returns to Kalevala, he meets the Lady of the
Rainbow, seated on the arch of the sky, weaving the
golden thread. She promises to be his, if he will
accomplish certain tasks, and in the course of those
he wounds himself with an axe. The wound can
only be healed by one who knows the mystic words
that hold the secret of the birth of iron. The legend
of this evil birth, how iron grew from the milk of a
maiden, and was forged by the primeval smith, Ilmarinen,
to be the bane of warlike men, is communicated
by W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen to an old magician. The
wizard then solemnly curses the iron, <em>as a living
thing</em>, and invokes the aid of the supreme God Ukko,
thus bringing together in one prayer the extremes of
early religion. Then the hero is healed, and gives
thanks to the Creator, &lsquo;in whose hands is the end of
a matter.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Returning to Kalevala, W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen sends Ilmarinen
to Pohjola to make the sampo, &lsquo;a mill for corn
one day, for salt the next, for money the next.&rsquo; The
fatal treasure is concealed by Loutri, and is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
obviously to play the part of the fairy hoard in the &lsquo;Nibelungen
Lied.&rsquo;</p>

<p>With the eleventh canto a new hero, Ahti, or
Lemminkainen, and a new cycle of adventures, is
abruptly introduced. Lemminkainen is a profligate
wanderer, with as many loves as Hercules. The fact
that he is regarded as a form of the sea-god makes it
strange that his most noted achievement, the seduction
of the whole female population of his island, should
correspond with a like feat of Krishna&rsquo;s. &lsquo;Sixteen
thousand and one hundred,&rsquo; says the Vishnu Purana,
&lsquo;was the number of the maidens; and into so many
forms did the son of Madhu multiply himself, so that
every one of the damsels thought that he had wedded
her in her single person.&rsquo; Krishna is the sun, perhaps,
and the maidens are the dew-drops; it is to
be hoped that Lemminkainen&rsquo;s connection with sea-water
may save him from the solar hypothesis. His
first regular marriage is unhappy, and he is slain in
trying to capture a bride from the people of Pohjola.
The black waters of the river of forgetfulness sweep
him away, and his comb, which he left with his mother,
bursts out bleeding&mdash;a frequent incident in Russian
and other fairy tales. In many household tales, the
hero, before setting out on a journey, erects a stick
which will fall down when he is in distress, or death.
The natives of Australia use this form of divination
in actual practice, tying round the stick some of the
hair of the person whose fate is to be ascertained.
Then, like Demeter seeking Persephone, the mother
questions all the beings of the world, and their answers
show a wonderful poetic sympathy with the silent life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
of Nature. &lsquo;The moon said, I have sorrows enough
of my own, without thinking of thy child. My lot is
hard, my days are evil. I am born to wander companionless
in the night, to shine in the season of frost,
to watch through the endless winter, to fade when
summer comes as king.&rsquo; The sun is kinder, and
reveals the place of the hero&rsquo;s body. The mother
collects the scattered limbs, the birds bring healing
balm from the heights of heaven, and after a hymn
to the goddess of man&rsquo;s blood, Lemminkainen is
made sound and well, as the scattered &lsquo;fragments of
no more a man&rsquo; were united by the spell of Medea,
like those of Osiris by Isis, or of the fair countess by
the demon blacksmith in the Russian <i>M&auml;rchen</i>, or of
the Carib hero mentioned by Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> or of
the ox in the South African household tale.</p>

<p>With the sixteenth canto we turn to W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen,
who, like all epic heroes, visits the place of
the dead, Tuonela. The maidens who play the part
of Charon are with difficulty induced to ferry over a
man bearing no mark of death by fire or sword or
water. Once among the dead, W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen refuses&mdash;being
wiser than Psyche or Persephone&mdash;to taste
of drink. This &lsquo;taboo&rsquo; is found in Japanese, Melanesian,
and Red Indian accounts of the homes of the
dead. Thus the hero is able to return and behold
the stars. Arrived in the upper world, he warns men
to &lsquo;beware of perverting innocence, of leading astray
the pure of heart; they that do these things shall be
punished eternally in the depths of Tuoni. There is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
a place prepared for evil-doers, a bed of stones burning,
rocks of fire, worms and serpents.&rsquo; This speech
throws but little light on the question of how far a
doctrine of rewards and punishments enters into
primitive ideas of a future state. The &lsquo;Kalevala,&rsquo; as
we possess it, is necessarily, though faintly, tinged
with Christianity; and the peculiar vices which are
here threatened with punishment are not those which
would have been most likely to occur to the early
heathen singers of this <i>runot</i>.</p>

<p>W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen and Ilmarinen now go together to
Pohjola, but the fickle maiden of the land prefers the
young forger of the sampo to his elder and imperturbable
companion. Like a northern Medea, or like the
Master-maid in Dr. Dasent&rsquo;s <i>Tales from the Norse</i>,
or like the hero of the Algonquin tale and the Samoan
ballad, she aids her alien lover to accomplish the
tasks assigned to him. He ploughs with a plough
of gold the adder-close, or field of serpents; he bridles
the wolf and the bear of the lower world, and catches
the pike that swim in the waters of forgetfulness.
After this, the parents cannot refuse their consent,
the wedding-feast is prepared, and all the world, except
the <i>s&eacute;duisant</i> Lemminkainen, is bidden to the
banquet. The narrative now brings in the ballads
that are sung at a Finnish marriage.</p>

<p>First, the son-in-law enters the house of the parents
of the bride, saying, &lsquo;Peace abide with you in this
illustrious hall.&rsquo; The mother answers, &lsquo;Peace be
with you even in this lowly hut.&rsquo; Then W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen
began to sing, and no man was so hardy as to clasp
hands and contend with him in song. Next follow the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
songs of farewell, the mother telling the daughter of
what she will have to endure in a strange home:
&lsquo;Thy life was soft and delicate in thy father&rsquo;s house.
Milk and butter were ready to thy hand; thou wert
as a flower of the field, as a strawberry of the wood;
all care was left to the pines of the forest, all wailing
to the wind in the woods of barren lands. But now
thou goest to another home, to an alien mother, to
doors that grate strangely on their hinges.&rsquo; &lsquo;My
thoughts,&rsquo; the maiden replies, &lsquo;are as a dark night
of autumn, as a cloudy day of winter; my heart is
sadder than the autumn night, more weary than the
winter day.&rsquo; The maid and the bridegroom are then
lyrically instructed in their duties: the girl is to be
long-suffering, the husband to try five years&rsquo; gentle
treatment before he cuts a willow wand for his wife&rsquo;s
correction. The bridal party sets out for home, a
new feast is spread, and the bridegroom congratulated
on the courage he must have shown in stealing
a girl from a hostile tribe.</p>

<p>While all is merry, the mischievous Lemminkainen
sets out, an unbidden guest, for Pohjola. On
his way he encounters a serpent, which he slays by
the song of serpent-charming. In this &lsquo;mystic chain
of verse&rsquo; the serpent is not addressed as the gentle
reptile, god of southern peoples, but is spoken of with
all hatred and loathing: &lsquo;Black creeping thing of the
low lands, monster flecked with the colours of death,
thou that hast on thy skin the stain of the sterile soil,
get thee forth from the path of a hero.&rsquo; After slaying
the serpent, Lemminkainen reaches Pohjola, kills one
of his hosts, and fixes his head on one of a thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
stakes for human skulls that stood about the house,
as they might round the hut of a Dyak in Borneo.
He then flees to the isle of Saari, whence he is
driven for his heroic profligacy, and by the hatred of
the only girl whom he has <em>not</em> wronged. This is a
very pretty touch of human nature.</p>

<p>He now meditates a new incursion into Pohjola.
The mother of Pohjola (it is just worth noticing that
the leadership assumed by this woman points to a
state of society when the family was scarcely formed)
calls to her aid &lsquo;her child the Frost&rsquo;; but the frost is
put to shame by a hymn of the invader&rsquo;s, a song
against the Cold: &lsquo;The serpent was his foster-mother,
the serpent with her barren breasts; the wind of the
north rocked his cradle, and the ice-wind sang him to
sleep, in the midst of the wild marsh-land, where the
wells of the waters begin.&rsquo; It is a curious instance of
the animism, the vivid power of personifying all the
beings and forces of nature, which marks the &lsquo;Kalevala,&rsquo;
that the Cold speaks to Lemminkainen in
human voice, and seeks a reconciliation.</p>

<p>At this part of the epic there is an obvious lacuna.
The story goes to Kullervo, a luckless man, who
serves as shepherd to Ilmarinen. Thinking himself ill-treated
by the heroic smith&rsquo;s wife, the shepherd changes
his flock into bears and wolves, which devour their mistress.
Then he returns to his own home, where he learns
that his sister has been lost for many days, and is believed
to be dead. Travelling in search of her he meets a
girl, loves her, and all unwittingly commits an inexpiable
offence. &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; says the &lsquo;Kalevala,&rsquo; &lsquo;came up
the new dawn, and the maiden spoke, saying, &ldquo;What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
is thy race, bold young man, and who is thy father?&rdquo;
Kullervo said, &ldquo;I am the wretched son of Kalerva;
but tell me, what is thy race, and who is thy father?&rdquo;
Then said the maiden, &ldquo;I am the wretched daughter
of Kalerva. Ah! would God that I had died, then
might I have grown with the green grass, and blossomed
with the flowers, and never known this sorrow.&rdquo;
With this she sprang into the midst of the foaming
waves, and found peace in Tuoni, and rest in the
waters of forgetfulness.&rsquo; Then there was no word
for Kullervo, but the bitter moan of the brother in
the terrible Scotch ballad of the <i>Bonny Hind</i>, and no
rest but in death by his own sword, where grass
grows never on his sister&rsquo;s tomb.</p>

<p>The epic now draws to a close. Ilmarinen seeks
a new wife in Pohja, and endeavours with W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen&rsquo;s
help to recover the mystic sampo. On the
voyage, the Runoia makes a harp out of the bones of
a monstrous fish, so strange a harp that none may
play it but himself. When he played, all four-footed
things came about him, and the white birds dropped
down &lsquo;like a storm of snow.&rsquo; The maidens of the
sun and the moon paused in their weaving, and the
golden thread fell from their hands. The Ancient
One of the sea-water listened, and the nymphs of the
wells forgot to comb their loose locks with the golden
combs. All men and maidens and little children
wept, amid the silent joy of nature; nay, the great
harper wept, and <em>of his tears were pearls made</em>.</p>

<p>In the war with Pohjola the heroes were victorious,
but the sampo was broken in the fight, and lost in the
sea, and that, perhaps, is &lsquo;why the sea is salt.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
Fragments were collected, however, and Loutri, furious at
the success of the heroes of Kalevala, sent against
them a bear, destructive as the boar of Calydon. But
W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen despatched the monster, and the body
was brought home with the bear-dance, and the
hymn of the bear. &lsquo;Oh, Otso,&rsquo; cry the singers, &lsquo;be not
angry that we come near thee. The bear, the honey-footed
bear, was born in lands between sun and moon,
and he died not by men&rsquo;s hands, but of his own will.&rsquo;
The Finnish savants are probably right, who find
here a trace of the beast-worship which in many
lands has placed the bear among the number of the
stars. Propitiation of the bear is practised by Red
Indians, by the Ainos of Japan, and (in the case of
the &lsquo;native bear&rsquo;) by Australians. The Red Indians
have a myth to prove that the bear is immortal, does
not die, but, after his apparent death, rises again in
another body. There is no trace, however, that the
Finns claimed, like the Danes, descent from the bear.
The Lapps, a people of confused belief, worshipped
him along with Thor, Christ, the sun, and the serpent.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>But another cult, an alien creed, is approaching
Kalevala. There is no part of the poem more strange
than the closing canto, which tells in the wildest
language, and through the most exaggerated forms
of savage imagination, the tale of the introduction of
Christianity. Marjatta was a maiden, &lsquo;as pure as the
dew is, as holy as stars are that live without stain.&rsquo;
As she fed her flocks, and listened to the singing of
the golden cuckoo, a berry fell into her bosom. After
many days she bore a child, and the people despised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
and rejected her, and she was thrust forth, and her
babe was born in a stable, and cradled in the manger.
Who should baptise the babe? The god of the wilderness
refused, and W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen would have had
the young child slain. Then the infant rebuked the
ancient Demigod, who fled in anger to the sea, and
with his magic song he built a magic barque, and he
sat therein, and took the helm in his hand. The
tide bore him out to sea, and he lifted his voice and
sang: &lsquo;Times go by, and suns shall rise and set,
and then shall men have need of me, and shall look
for the promise of my coming that I may make a
new sampo, and a new harp, and bring back sunlight
and moonshine, and the joy that is banished
from the world.&rsquo; Then he crossed the waters, and
gained the limits of the sea, and the lower spaces of
the sky.</p>

<p>Here the strange poem ends at its strangest
moment, with the cry, which must have been uttered
so often, but is heard here alone, of a people reluctantly
deserting the gods that it has fashioned in
its own likeness, for a faith that has not sprung from
its needs or fears. Yet it cherishes the hope that
this tyranny shall pass over: &lsquo;they are gods, and
behold they shall die, and the waves be upon them
at last.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As the &lsquo;Kalevala,&rsquo; and as all relics of folklore,
all <i>M&auml;rchen</i> and ballads prove, the lower mythology&mdash;the
elemental beliefs of the people&mdash;do survive beneath
a thin covering of Christian conformity. There
are, in fact, in religion, as in society, two worlds, of
which the one does not know how the other lives.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
The class whose literature we inherit, under whose
institutions we live, at whose shrines we worship, has
changed as outworn raiment its manners, its gods,
its laws; has looked before and after, has hoped and
forgotten, has advanced from the wilder and grosser
to the purest faith. Beneath the progressive class,
and beneath the waves of this troublesome world,
there exists an order whose primitive form of human
life has been far less changeful, a class which has
put on a mere semblance of new faiths, while half-consciously
retaining the remains of immemorial
cults.</p>

<p>Obviously, as M. Fauriel has pointed out in the
case of the modern Greeks, the life of such folk contains
no element of progress, admits no break in
continuity. Conquering armies pass and leave them
still reaping the harvest of field and river; religions
appear, and they are baptised by thousands, but the
lower beliefs and dreads that the progressive class
has outgrown remain unchanged.</p>

<p>Thus, to take the instance of modern Greece, the
high gods of the divine race of Achilles and Agamemnon
are forgotten, but the descendants of the
Penest&aelig;, the <i>villeins</i> of Thessaly, still dread the
beings of the popular creed, the Nereids, the Cyclopes,
and the Lamia.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>The last lesson we would attempt to gather from
the &lsquo;Kalevala&rsquo; is this: that a comparison of the
<em>thoroughly popular</em> beliefs of all countries, the beliefs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
cherished by the non-literary classes whose ballads
and fairy tales have only recently been collected,
would probably reveal a general identity, concealed
by diversity of name, among the &lsquo;lesser people of
the skies,&rsquo; the elves, fairies, cyclopes, giants, nereids,
brownies, lami&aelig;. It could then be shown that some
of these spirits survive among the lower beings of
the mythology of what the Germans call a <i>cultur-volk</i>
like the Greeks or Romans. It could also be proved
that much of the narrative element in the classic epics
is to be found in a popular or childish form in primitive
fairy tales. The question would then come to be, Have
the higher mythologies been developed, by artistic
poets, out of the materials of a race which remained
comparatively untouched by culture; or are the lower
spirits, and the more simple and puerile forms of
myth, degradations of the inventions of a cultivated
class? In the majority of cases, the former theory
is correct.</p>

This constant struggle may be, and of course by one school of
comparative mythologists will be, represented as the strife between
light and darkness, the sun&rsquo;s rays, and the clouds of night, and so on.
M. Castren has well pointed out that the struggle has really an historical

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10"></a><i>THE DIVINING ROD.</i></h2>


<p>There is something remarkable, and not flattering
to human sagacity, in the periodical resurrection of
superstitions. Houses, for example, go on being
&lsquo;haunted&rsquo; in country districts, and no educated man
notices the circumstance. Then comes a case like
that of the Drummer of Tedworth, or the Cock Lane
Ghost, and society is deeply moved, philosophers
plunge into controversy, and he who grubs among
the dusty tracts of the past finds a world of fugitive
literature on forgotten bogies. Chairs move untouched
by human hands, and tables walk about in
lonely castles of Savoy, and no one marks them, till
a day comes when the furniture of some American
cottage is similarly afflicted, and then a shoddy new
religion is based on the phenomenon. The latest
revival among old beliefs is faith in the divining rod.
&lsquo;Our liberal shepherds give it a <em>shorter</em> name,&rsquo; and
so do our conservative peasants, calling the &lsquo;rod of
Jacob&rsquo; the &lsquo;twig.&rsquo; To &lsquo;work the twig&rsquo; is rural English
for the craft of Dousterswivel in the <i>Antiquary</i>,
and perhaps from this comes our slang expression
to &lsquo;twig,&rsquo; or divine, the hidden meaning of another.
Recent correspondence in the newspapers has proved
that, whatever may be the truth about the &lsquo;twig,&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
belief in its powers is still very prevalent. Respectable
people are not ashamed to bear signed witness
to its miraculous powers of detecting springs of water
and secret mines. It is habitually used by the miners
in the Mendips, as Mr. Woodward found ten years
ago; and forked hazel divining rods from the Mendips
are a recognised part of ethnological collections.
There are two ways of investigating the facts or
fancies about the rod. One is to examine it in its
actual operation&mdash;a task of considerable labour,
which will doubtless be undertaken by the Society
for Psychical Research; the other, and easier, way is
to study the appearances of the divining wand in
history, and that is what we propose to do in this
article.</p>

<p>When a superstition or belief is widely spread in
Europe, as the faith in the divining rod certainly is
(in Germany rods are hidden under babies&rsquo; clothes
when they are baptised), we naturally expect to find
traces of it in ancient times and among savages all
over the modern world. We have already examined
in &lsquo;The Bull-Roarer&rsquo; a very similar example. We
saw that there is a magical instrument&mdash;a small
fish-shaped piece of thin flat wood tied to a thong&mdash;which,
when whirled in the air, produces a strange
noise, a compound of roar and buzz. This instrument
is sacred among the natives of Australia, where
it is used to call together the men, and to frighten
away the women from the religious mysteries of the
males. The same instrument is employed for similar
purposes in New Mexico, and in South Africa and
New Zealand&mdash;parts of the world very widely distant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
from each other, and inhabited by very diverse races.
It has also been lately discovered that the Greeks used
this toy, which they called <ins class="greek" title="rhombos">&#8165;&#8057;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#962;</ins>, in the Mysteries
of Dionysus, and possibly it may be identical with
the <i>mystica vannus Iacchi</i> (Virgil, <i>Georgics</i>, i. 166).
The conclusion drawn by the ethnologist is that
this object, called <i>turndun</i> by the Australians, is a
very early savage invention, probably discovered and
applied to religious purposes in various separate
centres, and retained from the age of savagery in
the mystic rites of Greeks and perhaps of Romans.
Well, do we find anything analogous in the case of
the divining rod?</p>

<p>Future researches may increase our knowledge,
but at present little or nothing is known of the divining
rod in classical ages, and not very much (though that
little is significant) among uncivilised races. It is
true that in all countries rods or wands, the Latin
<i>virga</i>, have a magical power. Virgil obtained his
medi&aelig;val repute as a wizard because his name was
erroneously connected with <i>virgula</i>, the magic wand.
But we do not actually know that the ancient wand
of the enchantress Circe, in Homer, or the wand of
Hermes, was used, like the divining rod, to indicate
the whereabouts of hidden wealth or water. In the
Homeric hymn to Hermes (line 529), Apollo thus
describes the <i>caduceus</i>, or wand of Hermes: &lsquo;Thereafter
will I give thee a lovely wand of wealth and
riches, a golden wand with three leaves, which shall
keep thee ever unharmed.&rsquo; In later art this wand,
or <i>caduceus</i>, is usually entwined with serpents; but
on one vase, at least, the wand of Hermes is simply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
the forked twig of our rustic miners and water-finders.
The same form is found on an engraved Etruscan
mirror.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Now, was a wand of this form used in classical
times to discover hidden objects of value? That
wands were used by Scythians and Germans in
various methods of casting lots is certain; but that
is not the same thing as the working of the twig.
Cicero speaks of a fabled wand by which wealth can
be procured; but he says nothing of the method of
its use, and possibly was only thinking of the rod of
Hermes, as described in the Homeric hymn already
quoted. There was a Roman <i>satura</i>, by Varro, called
&lsquo;Virgula Divina&rsquo;; fragments remain, but throw no
light on the subject. A passage usually quoted from
Seneca has no more to do with the divining rod than
with the telephone. Pliny is a writer extremely fond
of marvels; yet when he describes the various modes
of finding wells of water, he says nothing about the
divining wand. The isolated texts from Scripture
which are usually referred to clearly indicate wands
of a different sort, if we except Hosea iv. 12, the
passage used as motto by the author of <i>Lettres qui
d&eacute;couvrent l&rsquo;illusion des Philosophes sur la Baguette</i>
(1696). This text is translated in our Bible, &lsquo;My
people ask counsel at their stocks, <em>and their staff
declareth unto them</em>.&rsquo; Now, we have here no reference
to the search for wells and minerals, but to a form of
divination for which the modern twig has ceased to
be applied. In rural England people use the wand
to find water, but not to give advice, or to detect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
thieves or murderers; but, as we shall see, the rod
has been very much used for these purposes within
the last three centuries.</p>

<p>This brings us to the moral powers of the twig;
and here we find some assistance in our inquiry from
the practices of uncivilised races. In 1719 John Bell
was travelling across Asia; he fell in with a Russian
merchant, who told him of a custom common among
the Mongols. The Russian had lost certain pieces
of cloth, which were stolen out of his tent. The
Kutuchtu Lama ordered the proper steps to be
taken to find out the thief. &lsquo;One of the Lamas
took a bench with four feet, and after turning it in
several directions, at last it pointed directly to the tent
where the stolen goods were concealed. The Lama
now mounted across the bench, and soon carried it, or,
as was commonly believed, it carried him, to the very
tent, where he ordered the damask to be produced.
The demand was directly complied with; for it is vain
in such cases to offer any excuse.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Here we have not
a wand, indeed, but a wooden object which turned in
the direction, not of water or minerals, but of human
guilt. A better instance is given by the Rev. H.
Rowley, in his account of the Mauganja.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> A thief
had stolen some corn. The medicine-man, or sorcerer,
produced two sticks, which he gave to four young
men, two holding each stick. The medicine-man
danced and sang a magical incantation, while a zebra-tail
and a rattle were shaken over the holders of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
sticks. &lsquo;After a while, the men with the sticks had
spasmodic twitchings of the arms and legs; these
increased nearly to convulsions.... According to
the native idea, <em>it was the sticks which were possessed
primarily</em>, and through them the men, <em>who could hardly
hold them</em>. The sticks whirled and dragged the men
round and round like mad, through bush and thorny
shrub, and over every obstacle; nothing stopped
them; their bodies were torn and bleeding. At last
they came back to the assembly, whirled round again,
and rushed down the path to fall panting and
exhausted in the hut of one of a chief&rsquo;s wives. The
sticks, rolling to her very feet, denounced her as a
thief. She denied it; but the medicine-man answered,
&ldquo;The spirit has declared her guilty; the spirit never
lies.&rdquo;&rsquo; The woman, however, was acquitted, after
a proxy trial by ordeal: a cock, used as her proxy,
threw up the <i>muavi</i>, or ordeal-poison.</p>

<p>Here the points to be noted are, first, the violent
movement of the sticks, which the men could hardly
hold; next, the physical agitation of the men. The
former point is illustrated by the confession of a civil
engineer writing in the <i>Times</i>. This gentleman had
seen the rod successfully used for water; he was asked
to try it himself, and he determined that it should not
twist in his hands &lsquo;if an ocean rolled under his feet.&rsquo;
Twist it did, however, in spite of all his efforts to hold
it, when he came above a concealed spring. Another
example is quoted in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, vol.
xxii. p. 374. A narrator, in whom the editor &lsquo;had
implicit confidence,&rsquo; mentions how, when a lady held
the twig just over a hidden well, &lsquo;the twig turned so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
quick as to snap, breaking near her fingers.&rsquo; There
seems to be no indiscretion in saying, as the statement
has often been printed before, that the lady spoken
of in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> was Lady Milbanke,
mother of the wife of Byron. Dr. Hutton, the geologist,
is quoted as a witness of her success in the search
for water with the divining rod. He says that, in an
experiment at Woolwich, &lsquo;the twigs twisted themselves
off below her fingers which were considerably
indented by so forcibly holding the rods between
them.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Next, the violent excitement of the four
young men of the Mauganja is paralleled by the
physical experience of the lady quoted in the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>. &lsquo;A degree of agitation was visible
in her face when she first made the experiment; she
says this agitation was great&rsquo; when she began to
practise the art, or whatever we are to call it. Again,
in <i>Lettres qui d&eacute;couvrent l&rsquo;illusion</i> (p. 93), we read
that Jacques Aymar (who discovered the Lyons
murderer in 1692) <i>se sent tout &eacute;mu</i>&mdash;feels greatly
agitated&mdash;when he comes on that of which he is in
search. On page 97 of the same volume, the body
of the man who holds the divining rod is described
as &lsquo;violently agitated.&rsquo; When Aymar entered the
room where the murder, to be described later, was
committed, &lsquo;his pulse rose as if he were in a burning
fever, and the wand turned rapidly in his hands&rsquo;
(<i>Lettres</i>, p. 107). But the most singular parallel to
the performance of the African wizard must be quoted
from a curious pamphlet already referred to, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
translation of the old French <i>Verge de Jacob</i>, written,
annotated, and published by a Mr. Thomas Welton.
Mr. Welton seems to have been a believer in mesmerism,
animal magnetism, and similar doctrines, but
the coincidence of his story with that of the African
sorcerer is none the less remarkable. It is a coincidence
which must almost certainly be &lsquo;undesigned.&rsquo;
Mr. Welton&rsquo;s wife was what modern occult philosophers
call a &lsquo;Sensitive.&rsquo; In 1851, he wished her to
try an experiment with the rod in a garden, and sent
a maid-servant to bring &lsquo;a certain stick that stood
behind the parlour door. In great terror she brought
it to the garden, her hand firmly clutched on the
stick, nor could she let it go....&rsquo; The stick was
given to Mrs. Welton, &lsquo;and it drew her with very considerable
force to nearly the centre of the garden, to
a bed of poppies, where she stopped.&rsquo; Here water
was found, and the gardener, who had given up his
lease as there was no well in the garden, had the lease
renewed.</p>

<p>We began by giving evidence to show (and much
more might be adduced) that the belief in the divining
rod, or in analogous instruments, is not confined to the
European races. The superstition, or whatever we
are to call it, produces the same effects of physical
agitation, and the use of the rod is accompanied with
similar phenomena among Mongols, English people,
Frenchmen, and the natives of Central Africa. The
same coincidences are found in almost all superstitious
practices, and in the effects of these practices on
believers. The Chinese use a form of <i>planchette</i>,
which is half a divining rod&mdash;a branch of the peach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
tree; and &lsquo;spiritualism&rsquo; is more than three-quarters of
the religion of most savage tribes, a Maori <i>s&eacute;ance</i> being
more impressive than anything the civilised Sludge
can offer his credulous patrons. From these facts
different people draw different inferences. Believers
say that the wide distribution of their favourite
mysteries is a proof that &lsquo;there is something in them.&rsquo;
The incredulous look on our modern &lsquo;twigs&rsquo; and
turning-tables and ghost stories as mere &lsquo;survivals&rsquo;
from the stage of savage culture, or want of culture,
when the fancy of half-starved man was active and
his reason uncritical.</p>

<p>The great authority for the modern history of the
divining rod is a work published by M. Chevreuil,
in Paris, in 1854. M. Chevreuil, probably with truth,
regarded the wand as much on a par with the turning-tables,
which, in 1854, attracted a good deal of attention.
He studied the topic historically, and his book,
with a few accessible French tracts and letters of the
seventeenth century, must here be our guide. A
good deal of M. Chevreuil&rsquo;s learning, it should be
said, is reproduced in Mr. Baring Gould&rsquo;s <i>Curious
Myths of the Middle Ages</i>, but the French author
is much more exhaustive in his treatment of the
topic. M. Chevreuil could find no earlier book on
the twig than the <i>Testament du Fr&egrave;re Basil Valentin</i>,
a holy man who flourished (the twig) about 1413;
but whose treatise is possibly apocryphal. According
to Basil Valentin, the twig was regarded with awe
by ignorant labouring men, which is still true. Paracelsus,
though he has a reputation for magical daring,
thought the use of the twig &lsquo;uncertain and unlawful&rsquo;;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
and Agricola, in his <i>De Re Metallica</i> (1546), expresses
a good deal of scepticism about the use of the rod in
mining. A traveller of 1554 found that the wand
was <em>not</em> used&mdash;and this seems to have surprised
him&mdash;in the mines of Macedonia. Most of the
writers of the sixteenth century accounted for the
turning of the rod by &lsquo;sympathy,&rsquo; which was then as
favourite an explanation of everything as evolution
is to-day. In 1630 the Baron de Beau Soleil of
Bohemia (his name sounds rather Bohemian) came
to France with his wife, and made much use of the
rod in the search for water and minerals. The
Baroness wrote a little volume on the subject, afterwards
reprinted in a great storehouse of this lore,
<i>La Physique Occulte</i>, of Vallemont. Kircher, a Jesuit,
made experiments which came to nothing; but Gaspard
Schott, a learned writer, cautiously declined to
say that the Devil was always &lsquo;at the bottom of it&rsquo;
when the rod turned successfully. The problem of
the rod was placed before our own Royal Society
by Boyle, in 1666, but the Society was not more
successful here than in dealing with the philosophical
difficulty proposed by Charles II. In 1679
De Saint Romain, deserting the old hypothesis of
secret &lsquo;sympathies,&rsquo; explained the motion of the rod
(supposing it to move) by the action of <em>corpuscules</em>.
From this time the question became the playing
ground of the Cartesian and other philosophers.
The struggle was between theories of &lsquo;atoms,&rsquo;
magnetism, &lsquo;corpuscules,&rsquo; electric effluvia, and so forth,
on one side, and the immediate action of devils or of
conscious imposture, on the other. The controversy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
comparatively simple as long as the rod only indicated
hidden water or minerals, was complicated
by the revival of the savage belief that the wand
could &lsquo;smell out&rsquo; moral offences. As long as the
twig turned over material objects, you could imagine
sympathies and &lsquo;effluvia&rsquo; at pleasure. But when the
wand twirled over the scene of a murder, or dragged
the expert after the traces of the culprit, fresh explanations
were wanted. Le Brun wrote to Malebranche
on July 8, 1689, to tell him that the wand only
turned over what the holder had the <em>intention</em> of
discovering.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> If he were following a murderer, the
wand good-naturedly refused to distract him by turning
over hidden water. On the other hand, Vallemont
says that when a peasant was using the wand to find
water, it turned over a spot in a wood where a murdered
woman was buried, and it conducted the peasant
to the murderer&rsquo;s house. These events seem inconsistent
with Le Brun&rsquo;s theory of <em>intention</em>. Malebranche
replied, in effect, that he had only heard of
the turning of the wand over water and minerals;
that it then turned (if turn it did) by virtue of some
such force as electricity; that, if such force existed,
the wand would turn over open water. But it does
not so turn; and, as physical causes are constant,
it follows that the turning of the rod cannot be the
result of a physical cause. The only other explanation
is an intelligent cause&mdash;either the will of an
impostor, or the action of a spirit. Good spirits
would not meddle with such matters; therefore either
the Devil or an impostor causes the motion of the rod,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
if it <em>does</em> move at all. This logic of Malebranche&rsquo;s is
not agreeable to believers in the twig; but there the
controversy stood, till, in 1692, Jacques Aymar, a
peasant of Dauphin&eacute;, by the use of the twig discovered
one of the Lyons murderers.</p>

<p>Though the story of this singular event is pretty
well known, it must here be briefly repeated. No
affair can be better authenticated, and our version is
abridged from the &lsquo;Relations&rsquo; of &lsquo;Monsieur le Procureur
du Roi, Monsieur l&rsquo;Abb&eacute; de la Garde,
Monsieur Panthot, Doyen des M&eacute;decins de Lyon,
et Monsieur Aubert, Avocat c&eacute;l&egrave;bre.&rsquo;</p>

<p>On July 5, 1692, a vintner and his wife were
found dead in the cellar of their shop at Lyons.
They had been killed by blows from a hedging-knife,
and their money had been stolen. The culprits
could not be discovered, and a neighbour took upon
him to bring to Lyons a peasant out of Dauphin&eacute;,
named Jacques Aymar, a man noted for his skill
with the divining rod. The Lieutenant-Criminel and
the Procureur du Roi took Aymar into the cellar,
furnishing him with a rod of the first wood that
came to hand. According to the Procureur du Roi,
the rod did not move till Aymar reached the very
spot where the crime had been committed. His
pulse then rose, and the wand twisted rapidly.
&lsquo;Guided by the wand or by some internal sensation,&rsquo;
Aymar now pursued the track of the assassins,
entered the court of the Archbishop&rsquo;s palace, left the
town by the bridge over the Rhone, and followed
the right bank of the river. He reached a gardener&rsquo;s
house, which he declared the men had entered, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
some children confessed that three men (<i>whom they
described</i>) had come into the house one Sunday
morning. Aymar followed the track up the river,
pointed out all the places where the men had
landed, and, to make a long story short, stopped at
last at the door of the prison of Beaucaire. He was
admitted, looked at the prisoners, and picked out as
the murderer a little hunchback (had the children
described a hunchback?) who had just been brought
in for a small theft. The hunchback was taken to
Lyons, and he was recognised, on the way, by the
people at all the stages where he had stopped. At
Lyons he was examined in the usual manner, and
confessed that he had been an accomplice in the
crime, and had guarded the door. Aymar pursued
the other culprits to the coast, followed them by sea,
landed where they had landed, and only desisted
from his search when they crossed the frontier. As
for the hunchback, he was broken on the wheel,
being condemned on his own confession. It does
not appear that he was put to the torture to make
him confess. If this had been done his admissions
would, of course, have been as valueless as those of
the victims in trials for witchcraft.</p>

<p>This is, in brief, the history of the famous Lyons
murders. It must be added that many experiments
were made with Aymar in Paris, and that they were all
failures. He fell into every trap that was set for him;
detected thieves who were innocent, failed to detect
the guilty, and invented absurd excuses; alleging, for
example, that the rod would not indicate a murderer
who had confessed, or who was drunk when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
committed his crime. These excuses seem to annihilate
the wild contemporary theory of Chauvin and others,
that the body of a murderer naturally exhales an
invisible <i>mati&egrave;re meurtri&egrave;re</i>&mdash;peculiar indestructible
atoms, which may be detected by the expert with the
rod. Something like the same theory, we believe,
has been used to explain the pretended phenomena
of haunted houses. But the wildest philosophical
credulity is staggered by a <i>mati&egrave;re meurtri&egrave;re</i> which
is disengaged by the body of a sober, but not by that
of an intoxicated, murderer, which survives tempests
in the air, and endures for many years, but is dissipated
the moment the murderer confesses. Believers
in Aymar have conjectured that his real powers were
destroyed by the excitements of Paris, and that he
took to imposture; but this is an effort of too easy
good-nature. When Vallemont defended Aymar
(1693) in the book called <i>La Physique Occulte</i>, he
declared that Aymar was physically affected to an
unpleasant extent by <i>mati&egrave;re meurtri&egrave;re</i>, but was not
thus agitated when he used the rod to discover
minerals. We have seen that, if modern evidence
can be trusted, holders of the rod are occasionally
much agitated even when they are only in search of
wells. The story gave rise to a prolonged controversy,
and the case remains a judicial puzzle, but little
elucidated by the confession of the hunchback, who
may have been insane, or morbid, or vexed by constant
questioning till he was weary of his life. He was
only nineteen years of age.</p>

<p>The next use of the rod was very much like that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
of &lsquo;tipping&rsquo; and turning tables. Experts held it (as
did Le P&egrave;re M&eacute;nestrier, 1694), questions were asked,
and the wand answered by turning in various directions.
By way of showing the inconsistency of all
philosophies of the wand, it may be said that one
girl found that it turned over concealed gold if she held
gold in her hand, while another found that it indicated
the metal so long as she did <em>not</em> carry gold with her
in the quest. In the search for water, ecclesiastics
were particularly fond of using the rod. The Mar&eacute;chal
de Boufflers dug many wells, and found no
water, on the indications of a rod in the hands of the
Prieur de Dorenic, near Guise. In 1700 a cur&eacute;, near
Toulouse, used the wand to answer questions, which,
like <i>planchette</i>, it often answered wrong. The great
<i>sourcier</i>, or water-finder, of the eighteenth century
was one Bleton. He declared that the rod was a
mere index, and that physical sensations of the
searcher communicated themselves to the wand.
This is the reverse of the African theory, that the
stick is inspired, while the men who hold it are only
influenced by the stick. On the whole, Bleton&rsquo;s idea
seems the less absurd, but Bleton himself often failed
when watched with scientific care by the incredulous.
Paramelle, who wrote on methods of discovering
wells, in 1856, came to the conclusion that the wand
turns in the hands of certain individuals of peculiar
temperament, and that it is very much a matter of
chance whether there are, or are not, wells in the
places where it turns.</p>

<p>On the whole, the evidence for the turning of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
wand is a shade better than that for the magical
turning of tables. If there are no phenomena of this
sort at all, it is remarkable that the belief in them is
so widely diffused. But if the phenomena are purely
subjective, owing to the conscious or unconscious
action of nervous patients, then they are precisely of
the sort which the cunning medicine-man observes,
and makes his profit out of, even in the earliest
stages of society. Once introduced, these practices
never die out among the conservative and unprogressive
class of peasants; and, every now and then, they
attract the curiosity of philosophers, or win the belief
of the credulous among the educated classes. Then
comes, as we have lately seen, a revival of ancient
superstition. For it were as easy to pluck the comet
out of the sky by the tail, as to eradicate superstition
from the mind of man.</p>

<p>Perhaps one good word may be said for the
divining rod. Considering the chances it has enjoyed,
the rod has done less mischief than might have been
expected. It might very well have become, in Europe,
as in Asia and Africa, a kind of ordeal, or method
of searching for and trying malefactors. Men like
Jacques Aymar might have played, on a larger scale,
the part of Hopkins, the witch-finder. Aymar was,
indeed, employed by some young men to point out,
by help of the wand, the houses of ladies who had
been more frail than faithful. But at the end of the
seventeenth century in France, this research was not
regarded with favour, and put the final touch on
the discomfiture of Aymar. So far as we know,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
the hunchback of Lyons was the only victim of the
&lsquo;twig&rsquo; who ever suffered in civilised society. It is
true that, in rural England, the movements of a
Bible, suspended like a pendulum, have been thought
to point out the guilty. But even that evidence is
not held good enough to go to a jury.</p>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11"></a><i>HOTTENTOT MYTHOLOGY.</i></h2>


<p>&lsquo;What makes mythology mythological, in the true
sense of the word, is what is utterly unintelligible,
absurd, strange, or miraculous.&rsquo; So says Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller in the January number of the <i>Nineteenth
Century</i> for 1882. Men&rsquo;s attention would never have
been surprised into the perpetual study and questioning
of mythology if it had been intelligible and
dignified, and if its report had been in accordance
with the reason of civilised and cultivated races.
What mythologists wish to discover is the origin of
the countless disgusting, amazing, and incongruous
legends which occur in the myths of all known
peoples. According to Mr. M&uuml;ller&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>There are only two systems possible in which the irrational
element in mythology can be accounted for. One
school takes the irrational as a matter of fact; and if we
read that Daphne fled from Ph&oelig;bus, and was changed
into a laurel tree, that school would say that there probably
was a young lady called Aurora, like, for instance, Aurora
K&ouml;nigsmark; that a young man called Robin, or possibly a
man with red hair, pursued her, and that she hid behind a
laurel tree that happened to be there. This was the theory
of Euhemeros, re-established by the famous Abb&eacute; Bernier
[Mr. M&uuml;ller doubtless means Banier], and not quite extinct
even now. According to another school, the irrational
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
element in mythology is inevitable, and due to the influence
of language on thought, so that many of the legends of gods
and heroes may be rendered intelligible if only we can discover
the original meaning of their proper names. The
followers of this school try to show that Daphne, the laurel
tree, was an old name for the dawn, and that Phoibos was
one of the many names of the sun, who pursued the dawn
till she vanished before his rays. Of these two schools, the
former has always appealed to the mythologies of savage
nations, as showing that gods and heroes were originally
human beings, worshipped after their death as ancestors and
as gods, while the latter has confined itself chiefly to an
etymological analysis of mythological names in Greek,
Latin, and Sanskrit, and other languages, such as had been
sufficiently studied to admit of a scientific, grammatical, and
etymological treatment.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a long text for our remarks on Hottentot
mythology; but it is necessary to prove that there
are not two schools only of mythologists: that there
are inquirers who neither follow the path of Abb&eacute;
Banier, nor of the philologists, but a third way, unknown
to, or ignored by Mr. M&uuml;ller. We certainly
were quite unaware that Banier and Euhemeros were
very specially concerned, as Mr. M&uuml;ller thinks, with
savage mythology; but it is by aid of savage myths
that the school unknown to Mr. M&uuml;ller examines the
myths of civilised people like the Greeks. The
disciples of Mr. M&uuml;ller interpret all the absurdities of
Greek myth, the gods who are beasts on occasion,
the stars who were men, the men who become serpents
or deer, the deities who are cannibals and parricides
and adulterers, as the result of the influence of Aryan
speech upon Aryan thought. Men, in Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
opinion, had originally pure ideas about the gods, and
expressed them in language which we should call
figurative. The figures remained, when their meaning
was lost; the names were then supposed to be gods,
the <i>nomina</i> became <i>numina</i>, and out of the inextricable
confusion of thought which followed, the belief in
cannibal, bestial, adulterous, and incestuous gods was
evolved. That is Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s hypothesis; with him
the evolution, a result of a disease of language, has
been from early comparative purity to later religious
abominations. Opposed to him is what may be called
the school of Mr. Herbert Spencer: the modern Euhemerism,
which recognises an element of historical truth
in myths, as if the characters had been real characters,
and which, in most gods, beholds ancestral ghosts
raised to a higher power.</p>

<p>There remains a third system of mythical interpretation,
though Mr. M&uuml;ller says only two methods
are possible. The method, in this third case, is to see
whether the irrational features and elements of civilised
Greek myth occur also in the myths of savages who
speak languages quite unlike those from whose diseases
Mr. M&uuml;ller derives the corruption of religion.
If the same features recur, are they as much in
harmony with the mental habits of savages, such as
Bushmen and Hottentots, as they are out of accord
with the mental habits of civilised Greeks? If this
question can be answered in the affirmative, then it
may be provisionally assumed that the irrational
elements of savage myth are the legacy of savage
modes of thought, and have survived in the religion
of Greece from a time when the ancestors of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
Greeks were savages. But inquirers who use this
method do not in the least believe that either Greek
or savage gods were, for the more part, originally real
men. Both Greeks and savages have worshipped
the ghosts of the dead. Both Greeks and savages
assign to their gods the miraculous power of transformation
and magic, which savages also attribute to
their conjurers or shamans. The mantle (if he had a
mantle) of the medicine-man has fallen on the god;
but Zeus, or Indra, was not once a real medicine-man.
A number of factors combine in the conception of
Indra, or Zeus, as either god appears in Sanskrit or
Greek literature, of earlier or later date. Our school
does not hold anything so absurd as that Daphne
was a real girl pursued by a young man. But it
has been observed that, among most savage races,
metamorphoses like that of Daphne not only exist in
mythology, but are believed to occur very frequently
in actual life. Men and women are supposed to be
capable of turning into plants (as the bamboo in
Sarawak), into animals, and stones, and stars, and
those metamorphoses happen as contemporary events&mdash;for
example, in Samoa.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>When Mr. Lane was living at Cairo, and translating
the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, he found that the people
still believed in metamorphosis. Any day, just as in
the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, a man might find himself turned
by an enchanter into a pig or a horse. Similar
beliefs, not derived from language, supply the matter
of the senseless incidents in Greek myths.</p>

<p>Savage mythology is also full of metamorphoses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
Therefore the mythologists whose case we are stating,
when they find identical metamorphoses in the
classical mythologies, conjecture that these were first
invented when the ancestors of the Aryans were in
the imaginative condition in which a score of rude
races are to-day. This explanation they apply to
many other irrational elements in mythology. They
do not say &lsquo;Something like the events narrated in
these stories once occurred,&rsquo; nor &lsquo;A disease of language
caused the belief in such events,&rsquo; but &lsquo;These
stories were invented when men were capable of
believing in their occurrence as a not unusual sort of
incident.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Philologists attempt to explain the metamorphoses
as the result of some oblivion and confusion
of language. Apollo, they say, was called the &lsquo;wolf-god&rsquo;
(Lukeios) by accident: his name really meant
the &lsquo;god of light.&rsquo; A similar confusion made the
&lsquo;seven shiners&rsquo; into the &lsquo;seven bears.&rsquo; These explanations
are distrusted, partly because the area to
be covered by them is so vast. There is scarcely a
star, tree, or beast, but it has been a man or woman
once, if we believe civilised and savage myth. Two or
three possible examples of myths originating in forgetfulness
of the meaning of words, even if admitted, do
not explain the incalculable crowd of metamorphoses.
We account for these by saying that, to the savage
mind, which draws no hard and fast line between man
and nature, all such things are possible; possible
enough, at least, to be used as incidents in story.
Again, as has elsewhere been shown, the laxity of
philological reasoning is often quite extraordinary;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
while, lastly, philologists of the highest repute flatly
contradict each other about the meaning of the names
and roots on which they agree in founding their theory.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>By way of an example of the philological method
as applied to savage mythology, we choose a book
in many ways admirable, Dr. Hahn&rsquo;s <i>Tsuni Goam,
the Supreme Being of the Khoi Khoi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> This book
is sometimes appealed to as a crushing argument
against the mythologists who adopt the method
we have just explained. Let us see if the blow be
so very crushing. To put the case in a nutshell, the
Hottentots have commonly been described as a race
which worshipped a dead chief, or conjurer&mdash;Tsui
Goab his name is, meaning Wounded Knee, a not
unlikely name for a savage. Dr. Hahn, on the other
hand, labours to show that the Hottentots originally
worshipped no dead chief, but (as a symbol of the
Infinite) the Red Dawn. The meaning of the name
Red Dawn, he says, was lost; the words which meant
Red Dawn were erroneously supposed to mean
Wounded Knee, and thus arose the adoration and
the myths of a dead chief, or wizard, Tsui Goab,
Wounded Knee. Clearly, if this can be proved, it
is an excellent case for the philological school, an
admirable example of a myth produced by forgetfulness
of the meaning of words. Our own opinion is
that, even if Tsui Goab originally meant Red Dawn,
the being, as now conceived of by his adorers, is
bedizened in the trappings of the dead medicine-man,
and is worshipped just as ghosts of the dead are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
worshipped. Thus, whatever his origin, his myth is
freely coloured by the savage fancy and by savage
ideas, and we ask no more than this colouring to
explain the wildest Greek myths. What truly &lsquo;primitive&rsquo;
religion was, we make no pretence to know.
We only say that, whether Greek religion arose from
a pure fountain or not, its stream had flowed through
and been tinged by the soil of savage thought, before
it widens into our view in historical times. But it
will be shown that the logic which connects Tsui
Goab with the Red Dawn is far indeed from being
cogent.</p>

<p>Tsui Goab is thought by the Hottentots themselves
to be a dead man, and it is admitted that
among the Hottentots dead men are adored. &lsquo;Cairns
are still objects of worship,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> and Tsui Goab lies beneath
several cairns. Again, soothsayers are believed
in (p. 24), and Tsui Goab is regarded as a deceased
soothsayer. As early as 1655, a witness quoted by
Hahn saw women worshipping at one of the cairns
of Heitsi Eibib, another supposed ancestral being.
Kolb, the old Dutch traveller, found that the Hottentots,
like the Bushmen, revered the mantis insect.
This creature they called Gaunab. They also had
some moon myths, practised adoration of the moon,
and danced at dawn. Thunberg (1792) saw the
cairn-worship, and, on asking its meaning, was told
that a Hottentot lay buried there.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Thunberg also
heard of the worship of the mantis, or grey grasshopper.
In 1803 Liechtenstein noted the cairn-worship,
and was told that a renowned Hottentot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
doctor of old times rested under the cairn. Appleyard&rsquo;s
account of &lsquo;the name God in Khoi Khoi, or
Hottentot,&rsquo; deserves quoting in full:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Hottentot: Tsoei&rsquo;koap.</p>

<p>Namaqua: Tsoei&rsquo;koap.</p>

<p>Koranna: Tshu&rsquo;koab, and the author adds: &lsquo;This is
the word from which the Kafirs have probably derived
their u-Tixo, a term which they have universally applied,
like the Hottentots, to designate the Divine Being, since
the introduction of Christianity. Its derivation is curious.
It consists of two words, which together mean the &ldquo;wounded
knee.&rdquo; It is said to have been originally applied to a doctor
or sorcerer of considerable notoriety and skill amongst the
Hottentots or Namaquas some generations back, in consequence
of his having received some injury in his knee.
Having been held in high repute for extraordinary powers
during life, he appeared to be invoked even after death, as
one who could still relieve and protect; and hence, in
process of time, he became nearest in idea to their first
conceptions of God.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Other missionaries make old Wounded Knee a
good sort of being on the whole, who fights Gaunab,
a bad being. Dr. Moffat heard that &lsquo;Tsui Kuap&rsquo;
was &lsquo;a notable warrior,&rsquo; who once received a wound
in the knee. Sir James Alexander<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> found that the
Namaquas believed their &lsquo;great father&rsquo; lay below the
cairns on which they flung boughs. This great father
was Heitsi Eibib, and, like other medicine-men, &lsquo;he
could take many forms.&rsquo; Like Tsui Goab, he died
several times and rose again. Hahn gives (p. 61) a
long account of the Wounded Knee from an old
chief, and a story of the battle between Tsui Goab,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
who &lsquo;lives in a beautiful heaven,&rsquo; and Gaunab, who
&lsquo;lives in a dark heaven.&rsquo; As this chief had dwelt
among missionaries very long, we may perhaps discount
his remarks on &lsquo;heaven&rsquo; as borrowed. Hahn
thinks they refer to the red sky in which Tsui
Goab lived, and to the black sky which was the
home of Gaunab. The two characters in this crude
religious dualism thus inhabit light and darkness
respectively.</p>


<p class="hrpad">As far as we have gone, Tsui Goab, like Heitsi
Eibib among the Namas, is a dead sorcerer, whose
graves are worshipped, while, with a common inconsistency,
he is also thought of as dwelling in the
sky. Even Christians often speak of the dead with
similar inconsistency. Tsui Goab&rsquo;s worship is intelligible
enough among a people so credulous that they
took Hahn himself for a conjurer (p. 81), and so
given to ancestor-worship that Hahn has seen them
worship their own fathers&rsquo; graves, and expect help
from men recently dead (pp. 112, 113). But, while
the Khoi Khoi think that Tsui Goab was once a real
man, we need not share their Euhemerism. More
probably, like Unkulunkulu among the Zulus, Tsui
Goab is an ideal, imaginary ancestral sorcerer and
god. No one man requires many graves, and Tsui
Goab has more than Osiris possessed in Egypt.</p>

<p>If the Egyptians in some immeasurably distant
past were once on the level of Namas and Hottentots,
they would worship Osiris at as many barrows as
Heitsi Eibib and Tsui Goab are adored. In later
times the numerous graves of one being would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
require explanation, and explanations would be furnished
by the myth that the body of Osiris was
torn to pieces and each fragment buried in a separate
tomb.</p>

<p>Again, lame gods occur in Greek, Australian, and
Brazilian creeds, and the very coincidence of Tsui
Goab&rsquo;s lameness makes us sceptical about his claims
to be a real dead man. On the other hand, when
Hahn tells us that epical myths are now sung in the
dances in honour of warriors lately slain (p. 103), and
that similar dances and songs were performed in the
past to honour Tsui Goab, this looks more as if Tsui
Goab had been an actual person. Against this we
must set (p. 105) the belief that Tsui Goab made the
first man and woman, and was the Prometheus of the
Hottentots.</p>


<p class="hrpad">So far Dr. Hahn has given us facts which entirely
fit in with our theory that an ancestor-worshipping
people, believing in metamorphosis and sorcery,
adores a god who is supposed to be a deceased
ancestral sorcerer with the power of magic and
metamorphosis. But now Dr. Hahn offers his own
explanation. According to the philological method,
he will &lsquo;study the names of the persons, until we
arrive at the naked root and original meanings of the
words.&rsquo; Starting then with Tsui Goab, whom all
evidence declares to be a dead lame conjurer and
warrior, Dr. Hahn avers that &lsquo;Tsui Goab, originally
Tsuni Goam, was the name by which the Red Men
called the Infinite.&rsquo; As the Frenchman said of the
derivation of <i>jour</i> from <i>dies</i>, we may hint that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
Infinite thus transformed into a lame Hottentot &lsquo;bush-doctor&rsquo;
is <i>diablement chang&eacute; en route</i>. To a dead
lame sorcerer from the Infinite is a fall indeed. The
process of the decline is thus described. <i>Tsui Goab</i>
is composed of two roots, <i>tsu</i> and <i>goa</i>. <i>Goa</i> means
&lsquo;to go on,&rsquo; &lsquo;to come on.&rsquo; In Khoi Khoi <i>goa-b</i> means
&lsquo;the coming on one,&rsquo; the dawn, and <i>goa-b</i> also means
&lsquo;the knee.&rsquo; Dr. Hahn next writes (making a logical
leap of extraordinary width), &lsquo;It is now obvious that
<i>//goab</i> in Tsui Goab cannot be translated with knee,&rsquo;&mdash;why
not?&mdash;&lsquo;but we have to adopt the other metaphorical
meaning, the <em>approaching</em> day, <i>i.e.</i>, the dawn.&rsquo;
Where is the necessity? In ordinary philology, we
should here demand a number of attested examples
of <i>goab</i>, in the sense of dawn, but in Khoi Khoi we
cannot expect such evidence, as there are probably no
texts. Next, after arbitrarily deciding that all Khoi
Khois misunderstand their own tongue (for that is
what the rendering here of <i>goab</i> by &lsquo;dawn&rsquo; comes to),
Dr. Hahn examines <i>tsu</i>, in <i>Tsui</i>. <i>Tsu</i> means &lsquo;sore,&rsquo;
&lsquo;wounded,&rsquo; &lsquo;painful,&rsquo; as in &lsquo;wounded knee&rsquo;&mdash;Tsui
Goab. This does not help Dr. Hahn, for &lsquo;wounded
dawn&rsquo; means nothing. But he reflects that a wound
is red, <i>tsu</i> means wounded: therefore <i>tsu</i> means red,
therefore Tsui Goab is the Red Dawn. Q.E.D.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>This kind of reasoning is obviously fallacious.
Dr. Hahn&rsquo;s point could only be made by bringing
forward examples in which <i>tsu</i> is employed to mean
red in Khoi Khoi. Of this use of the word <i>tsu</i> he
does not give one single instance, and, in fact, does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
give another word for &lsquo;red,&rsquo; or &lsquo;bloody.&rsquo; His etymology
is not strengthened by the fact that Tsui Goab
has once been said to live in the red sky. A red
house is not necessarily tenanted by a red man.
Still less is the theory supported by the hymn which
says Tsui Goab paints himself with red ochre. Most
idols, from those of the Samoyeds to the Greek
images of Dionysus, are and have been daubed with
red.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> By such reasoning is Tsui Goab proved to be
the Red Dawn, while his gifts of prophecy (which
he shares with all soothsayers) are accounted for as
attributes of dawn, of the Vedic <i>Saranyu</i>.</p>

<p>Turning from Tsui Goab to his old enemy Gaunab,
we learn that his name is derived from <i>//gau</i>, &lsquo;to
destroy,&rsquo; and, according to old Hottentot ideas, &lsquo;no
one was the destroyer but the night&rsquo; (p. 126). There
is no apparent reason why the destroyer should be
the night, and the night alone, any more than why
&lsquo;a lame broken knee&rsquo; should be &lsquo;red&rsquo; (p. 126).
Besides (p. 85), Gaunab is elsewhere explained, not as
the night, but as the malevolent ghost which is thought
to kill people who die what we call a &lsquo;natural&rsquo; death.
Unburied men change into this sort of vampire, just
as Elpenor, in the <i>Odyssey</i>, threatens, if unburied, to
become mischievous. There is another Gaunab, the
mantis insect, which is worshipped by Hottentots and
Bushmen (p. 92). It appears that the two Gaunabs
are differently pronounced. However that may be, a
race which worships an insect might well worship a
dead medicine-man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
The conclusion, then, to be drawn from an examination
of Hottentot mythology is merely this, that
the ideas of a people will be reflected in their myths.
A people which worships the dead, believes in sorcerers
and in prophets, and in metamorphosis, will have for
its god (if he can be called a god) a being who is
looked on as a dead prophet and sorcerer. He will
be worshipped with such rites as dead men receive;
he will be mixed up in such battles as living men
wage, and will be credited with the skill which
living sorcerers claim. All these things meet in the
legend of Tsui Goab, the &lsquo;so-called supreme being&rsquo;
of the Hottentots. His connection with the dawn is
not supported by convincing argument or evidence.
The relation of the dawn to the Infinite again rests
on nothing but a theory of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> His
adversary, though recognised as the night, is elsewhere
admitted to have been, originally, a common
vampire. Finally, the Hottentots, a people not much
removed from savagery, have a mythology full of
savage and even disgusting elements. And this is
just what we expect from Hottentots. The puzzle is
when we find myths as low as the story of the incest
of Heitsi Eibib among the Greeks. The reason for
this coincidence is that, in Dr. Hahn&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;the
same objects and the same phenomena in nature
will give rise to the same ideas, whether social or
mythical, among different races of mankind,&rsquo; especially
when these races are in the same well-defined state of
savage fancy and savage credulity.</p>

<p>Dr. Hahn&rsquo;s book has been regarded as a kind of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
triumph over inquirers who believe that ancestor-worship
enters into myth, and that the purer element
in myth is the later. But where is the triumph?
Even on Dr. Hahn&rsquo;s own showing, ancestor-worship
among the Hottentots has swamped the adoration
of the Infinite. It may be said that Dr. Hahn has
at least proved the adoration of the Infinite to be
earlier than ancestor-worship. But it has been shown
that his attempt to establish a middle stage, to demonstrate
that the worshipped ancestor was really the Red
Dawn, is not logical nor convincing. Even if that
middle stage were established, it is a far cry from
the worship of Dawn (supposed by the Australians
to be a woman of bad character in a cloak of red
&rsquo;possum skin) to the adoration of the Infinite. Our
own argument has been successful if we have shown
that there are not only two possible schools of mythological
interpretation&mdash;the Euhemeristic, led by Mr.
Spencer, and the Philological, led by Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller. We have seen that it is possible to explain
the legend of Tsui Goab without either believing
him to have been a real historical person (as Mr.
Spencer may perhaps believe), or his myth to have
been the result of a &lsquo;disease of language,&rsquo; as Mr. M&uuml;ller
supposes. We have explained the legend and worship
of a supposed dead conjurer as natural to a race
which believes in conjurers and worships dead men.
Whether he was merely an ideal ancestor and
warrior, or whether an actual man has been invested
with what divine qualities Tsui Goab enjoys, it is impossible
to say; but, if he ever lived, he has long
been adorned with ideal qualities and virtues which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
he never possessed. The conception of the powerful
ancestral ghost has been heightened and adorned
with some novel attributes of power: the conception
of the Infinite has not been degraded, by forgetfulness
of language, to the estate of an ancestral ghost with
a game leg.</p>


<p class="hrpad">If this view be correct, myth is a disease of
thought, far more than a disease of language. The
comparative importance of language and thought was
settled long ago, in our sense, by no less a person
than Pragapati, the Sanskrit Master of Life.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now a dispute once took place between Mind
and Speech, as to which was the better of the two.
Both Mind and Speech said: &ldquo;I am excellent!&rdquo;
Mind said: &ldquo;Surely I am better than thou, for thou
dost not speak anything that is not understood by
me; and since thou art only an imitator of what is
done by me and a follower in my wake, I am surely
better than thou!&rdquo; Speech said: &ldquo;Surely I am
better than thou, for what thou knowest I make
known, I communicate.&rdquo; They went to appeal to
Prag&acirc;pati for his decision. He (Prag&acirc;pati) decided
in favour of Mind, saying (to Speech): &ldquo;Mind is
indeed better than thou, for thou art an imitator of
its deeds, and a follower in its wake; and inferior,
surely, is he who imitates his better&rsquo;s deeds, and
follows in his wake.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>So saith the &lsquo;Satapatha Brahmana.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12"></a><i>FETICHISM AND THE INFINITE.</i></h2>


<p>What is the true place of Fetichism, to use a
common but unscientific term, in the history of
religious evolution? Some theorists have made
fetichism, that is to say, the adoration of odds and
ends (with which they have confused the worship of
animals, of mountains, and even of the earth), the
first moment in the development of worship. Others,
again, think that fetichism is &lsquo;a corruption of religion,
in Africa, as elsewhere.&rsquo; The latter is the opinion of
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, who has stated it in his <i>Hibbert
Lectures</i>, on &lsquo;The Origin and Growth of Religion,
especially as illustrated by the Religions of India.&rsquo;
It seems probable that there is a middle position
between these two extremes. Students may hold
that we hardly know enough to justify us in talking
about the <em>origin</em> of religion, while at the same time
they may believe that Fetichism is one of the earliest
traceable steps by which men climbed to higher conceptions
of the supernatural. Meanwhile Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller supports his own theory, that fetichism is a
&lsquo;parasitical growth,&rsquo; a &lsquo;corruption&rsquo; of religion, by
arguments mainly drawn from historical study of
savage creeds, and from the ancient religious documents
of India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
These documents are to English investigators
ignorant of Sanskrit &lsquo;a book sealed with seven seals.&rsquo;
The Vedas are interpreted in very different ways by
different Oriental scholars. It does not yet appear
to be known whether a certain word in the Vedic
funeral service means &lsquo;goat&rsquo; or &lsquo;soul&rsquo;! Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s rendering is certain to have the first claim
on English readers, and therefore it is desirable to
investigate the conclusions which he draws from
his Vedic studies. The ordinary anthropologist must
first, however, lodge a protest against the tendency
to look for <em>primitive</em> matter in the Vedas. They are
the elaborate hymns of a specially trained set of
poets and philosophers, living in an age almost of
civilisation. They can therefore contain little testimony
as to what man, while still &lsquo;primitive,&rsquo; thought
about God, the world, and the soul. One might as
well look for the first germs of religion, for <em>primitive</em>
religion strictly so called, in <i>Hymns Ancient and
Modern</i> as in the Vedas. It is chiefly, however, by
way of deductions from the Vedas, that Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller arrives at ideas which may be briefly and
broadly stated thus: he inclines to derive religion
from man&rsquo;s sense of the Infinite, as awakened by
natural objects calculated to stir that sense. Our
position is, on the other hand, that the germs of the
religious sense in early man are developed, not so
much by the vision of the Infinite, as by the idea of
Power. Early religions, in short, are selfish, not disinterested.
The worshipper is not contemplative, so
much as eager to gain something to his advantage.
In fetiches, he ignorantly recognises something that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
possesses power of an abnormal sort, and the train of
ideas which leads him to believe in and to treasure
fetiches is one among the earliest springs of religious
belief.</p>

<p>Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s opinion is the very reverse: he
believes that a contemplative and disinterested emotion
in the presence of the Infinite, or of anything
that suggests infinitude or is mistaken for the Infinite,
begets human religion, while of this religion fetichism
is a later corruption.</p>


<p class="hrpad">In treating of fetichism Mr. M&uuml;ller is obliged to
criticise the system of De Brosses, who introduced
this rather unfortunate term to science, in an admirable
work, <i>Le Culte des Dieux F&eacute;tiches</i> (1760). We call
the work &lsquo;admirable,&rsquo; because, considering the contemporary
state of knowledge and speculation, De
Brosses&rsquo; book is brilliant, original, and only now
and then rash or confused. Mr. M&uuml;ller says that De
Brosses &lsquo;holds that all nations had to begin with
fetichism, to be followed afterwards by polytheism
and monotheism.&rsquo; This sentence would lead some
readers to suppose that De Brosses, in his speculations,
was looking for the origin of religion; but, in
reality, his work is a mere attempt to explain a
certain element in ancient religion and mythology.
De Brosses was well aware that heathen religions
were a complex mass, a concretion of many materials.
He admits the existence of regard for the spirits of
the dead as one factor, he gives Sabaeism a place as
another. But what chiefly puzzles him, and what he
chiefly tries to explain, is the worship of odds and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
ends of rubbish, and the adoration of animals, mountains,
trees, the sun, and so forth. When he masses
all these worships together, and proposes to call them
all Fetichism (a term derived from the Portuguese
word for a talisman), De Brosses is distinctly unscientific.
But De Brosses is distinctly scientific when he
attempts to explain the animal-worship of Egypt, and
the respect paid by Greeks and Romans to shapeless
stones, as survivals of older savage practices.</p>

<p>The position of De Brosses is this: Old mythology
and religion are a tissue of many threads.
Sabaeism, adoration of the dead, mythop&oelig;ic fancy,
have their part in the fabric. Among many African
tribes, a form of theism, Islamite, or Christian, or
self-developed, is superimposed on a mass of earlier
superstitions. Among these superstitions, is the worship
of animals and plants, and the cult of rough
stones and of odds and ends of matter. What is the
origin of this element, so prominent in the religion of
Egypt, and present, if less conspicuous, in the most
ancient temples of Greece? It is the survival, answers
De Brosses, of ancient practices like those of untutored
peoples, as Brazilians, Samoyeds, Negroes, whom the
Egyptians and Pelasgians once resembled in lack of
culture.</p>

<p>This, briefly stated, is the hypothesis of De Brosses.
If he had possessed our wider information, he would
have known that, among savage races, the worships
of the stars, of the dead, and of plants and animals,
are interlaced by the strange metaphysical processes
of wild men. He would, perhaps, have kept the
supernatural element in magical stones, feathers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
shells, and so on, apart from the triple thread of
Sabaeism, ghost-worship, and totemism, with its
later development into the regular worship of plants
and animals. It must be recognised, however, that
De Brosses was perfectly well aware of the confused
and manifold character of early religion. He had a
clear view of the truth that what the religious instinct
has once grasped, it does not, as a rule, abandon,
but subordinates or disguises, when it reaches higher
ideas. And he avers, again and again, that men laid
hold of the coarser and more material objects of worship,
while they themselves were coarse and dull, and
that, as civilisation advanced, they, as a rule, subordinated
and disguised the ruder factors in their system.
Here it is that Mr. Max M&uuml;ller differs from De Brosses.
He holds that the adoration of stones, feathers, shells,
and (as I understand him) the worship of animals are,
even among the races of Africa, a corruption of an
earlier and purer religion, a &lsquo;parasitical development&rsquo;
of religion.</p>

<p>However, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller himself held &lsquo;for a long
time&rsquo; what he calls &lsquo;De Brosses&rsquo; theory of fetichism.&rsquo;
What made him throw the theory overboard? It was
&lsquo;the fact that, while in the earliest accessible documents
of religious thought we look in vain for any
very clear traces of fetichism, they become more and
more frequent everywhere in the later stages of religious
development, and are certainly more visible in
the later corruptions of the Indian religion, beginning
with the &Acirc;tharva<i>n</i>a, than in the earliest hymns of
the Rig Veda.&rsquo; Now, by the earliest accessible documents
of religious thought, Professor Max M&uuml;ller
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
means the hymns of the Rig Veda. These hymns
are composed in the most elaborate metre, by sages
of old repute, who, I presume, occupied a position not
unlike that of the singers and seers of Israel. They
lived in an age of tolerably advanced cultivation.
They had wide geographical knowledge. They had
settled government. They dwelt in States. They
had wealth of gold, of grain, and of domesticated
animals. Among the metals, they were acquainted
with that which, in most countries, has been the latest
worked&mdash;they used iron poles in their chariots. How
then can the hymns of the most enlightened singers
of a race thus far developed be called &lsquo;the earliest
religious documents&rsquo;? Oldest they may be, the
oldest that are accessible, but this is a very different
thing. How can we possibly argue that what is
absent in these hymns, is absent because it had not
yet come into existence? Is it not the very office of
<i>pii vates et Ph&oelig;bo digna locuti</i> to purify religion, to
cover up decently its rude shapes, as the unhewn
stone was concealed in the fane of Apollo of Delos?
If the race whose noblest and oldest extant hymns
were pure, exhibits traces of fetichism in its later
documents, may not that as easily result from a recrudescence
as from a corruption? Professor Max
M&uuml;ller has still, moreover, to explain how the process
of corruption which introduced the same fetichistic
practices among Samoyeds, Brazilians, Kaffirs, and
the people of the &Acirc;tharva<i>n</i>a Veda came to be everywhere
identical in its results.</p>

<p>Here an argument often urged against the anthropological
method may be shortly disposed of.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
&lsquo;You examine savages,&rsquo; people say, &lsquo;but how do you
know that these savages were not once much more
cultivated; that their whole mode of life, religion
and all, is not debased and decadent from an earlier
standard?&rsquo; Mr. M&uuml;ller glances at this argument,
which, however, cannot serve his purpose. Mr.
M&uuml;ller has recognised that savage, or &lsquo;nomadic,&rsquo;
languages represent a much earlier state of language
than anything that we find for example, in the oldest
Hebrew or Sanskrit texts. &lsquo;For this reason,&rsquo; he
says,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> &lsquo;the study of what I call <em>nomad</em> languages,
as distinguished from <em>State</em> languages, becomes so
instructive. We see in them what we can no longer
expect to see even in the most ancient Sanskrit or
Hebrew. We watch the childhood of language with
all its childish freaks.&rsquo; Yes, adds the anthropologist,
and for this reason the study of savage religions,
as distinguished from State religions, becomes so
instructive. We see in them what we can no longer
expect to see even in the most ancient Sanskrit or
Hebrew faiths. We watch the childhood of religion
with all its childish freaks. If this reasoning be
sound when the Kaffir tongue is contrasted with
ancient Sanskrit, it should be sound when the Kaffir
faith is compared with the Vedic faith. By parity of
reasoning, the religious beliefs of peoples as much less
advanced than the Kaffirs as the Kaffirs are less advanced
than the Vedic peoples, should be still nearer
the infancy of faith, still &lsquo;nearer the beginning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>We have been occupied, perhaps, too long with
De Brosses and our apology for De Brosses. Let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
us now examine, as shortly as possible, Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s reasons for denying that fetichism is &lsquo;a
primitive form of religion.&rsquo; The negative side of
his argument being thus disposed of, it will then be
our business to consider (1) his psychological theory
of the subjective element in religion, and (2) his
account of the growth of Indian religion. The conclusion
of the essay will be concerned with demonstrating
that Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s system assigns little
or no place to the superstitious beliefs without which,
in other countries than India, society could not have
come into organised existence.</p>


<p class="hrpad">In his polemic against Fetichism, it is not always
very easy to see against whom Mr. M&uuml;ller is contending.
It is one thing to say that fetichism is a
&lsquo;primitive form of religion,&rsquo; and quite another to say
that it is &lsquo;the very beginning of all religion.&rsquo; Occasionally
he attacks the &lsquo;Comtian theory,&rsquo; which, I
think, is not now held by many people who study the
history of man, and which I am not concerned to
defend. He says that the Portuguese navigators
who discovered among the negroes &lsquo;no other trace of
any religious worship&rsquo; except what they called the
worship of <i>feiti&ccedil;os</i>, concluded that this was the whole
of the religion of the negroes (p. 61). Mr. M&uuml;ller
then goes on to prove that &lsquo;no religion consists of
fetichism only,&rsquo; choosing his examples of higher
elements in negro religion from the collections of
Waitz. It is difficult to see what bearing this has on
his argument. De Brosses (p. 20) shows that <em>he</em>, at
least, was well aware that many negro tribes have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
higher conceptions of the Deity than any which are
implied in fetich-worship. Even if no tribe in the
world is exclusively devoted to fetiches, the argument
makes no progress. Perhaps no extant tribe is in the
way of using unpolished stone weapons and no others,
but it does not follow that unpolished stone weapons
are not primitive. It is just as easy to maintain that
the purer ideas have, by this time, been reached by
aid of the stepping-stones of the grosser, as that the
grosser are the corruption of the purer. Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller constantly asserts that the &lsquo;human mind
advanced by small and timid steps from what is
intelligible, to what is at first sight almost beyond
comprehension&rsquo; (p. 126). Among the objects which
aided man to take these small and timid steps, he
reckons rivers and trees, which excited, he says,
religious awe. What he will not suppose is that the
earliest small and timid steps were not unaided by
such objects as the fetichist treasures&mdash;stones, shells,
and so forth, which suggest no idea of infinity.
Stocks he will admit, but not, if he can help it,
stones, of the sort that negroes and Kanekas and
other tribes use as fetiches. His reason is, that he
does not see how the scraps of the fetichist can
appeal to the feeling of the Infinite, which feeling is,
in his theory, the basis of religion.</p>

<p>After maintaining (what is readily granted) that
negroes have a religion composed of many elements,
Mr. M&uuml;ller tries to discredit the evidence about the
creeds of savages, and discourses on the many minute
shades of progress which exist among tribes too often
lumped together as if they were all in the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
condition. Here he will have all scientific students of
savage life on his side. It remains true, however,
that certain elements of savage practice, fetichism
being one of them, are practically ubiquitous. Thus,
when Mr. M&uuml;ller speaks of &lsquo;the influence of public
opinion&rsquo; in biassing the narrative of travellers, we
must not forget that the strongest evidence about
savage practice is derived from the &lsquo;undesigned
coincidence&rsquo; of the testimonies of all sorts of men,
in all ages, and all conditions of public opinion.
&lsquo;Illiterate men, ignorant of the writings of each
other, bring the same reports from various quarters
of the globe,&rsquo; wrote Millar of Glasgow. When sailors,
merchants, missionaries, describe, as matters unprecedented
and unheard of, such institutions as polyandry,
totemism, and so forth, the evidence is so
strong, because the witnesses are so astonished. They
do not know that any one but themselves has ever
noticed the curious facts before their eyes. And
when Mr. M&uuml;ller tries to make the testimony about
savage faith still more untrustworthy, by talking of
the &lsquo;absence of recognised authority among savages,&rsquo;
do not let us forget that custom (<ins class="greek" title="nomos">&#957;&#8057;&#956;&#959;&#962;</ins>) is a recognised
authority, and that the punishment of death is inflicted
for transgression of certain rules. These rules
generally speaking, are of a religious nature, and the
religion to which they testify is of the sort known
(too vaguely) as &lsquo;fetichistic.&rsquo; Let us keep steadily
before our minds, when people talk of lack of evidence,
that we have two of the strongest sorts of
evidence in the world for the kind of religion which
least suits Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s argument&mdash;(1) the undesigned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
coincidences of testimony, (2) the irrefutable witness
and sanction of elementary criminal law. Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
own evidence is that much-disputed work, where &lsquo;all
men see what they want to see, as in the clouds,&rsquo; and
where many see systematised fetichism&mdash;the Veda.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>The first step in Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s polemic was
the assertion that Fetichism is nowhere unmixed.
We have seen that the fact is capable of an interpretation
that will suit either side. Stages of culture
overlap each other. The second step in his polemic
was the effort to damage the evidence. We have
seen that we have as good evidence as can be desired.
In the third place he asks, What are the antecedents
of fetich-worship? He appears to conceive himself
to be arguing with persons (p. 127) who &lsquo;have taken
for granted that every human being was miraculously
endowed with the concept of what forms the predicate
of every fetich, call it power, spirit, or god.&rsquo;
If there are reasoners so feeble, they must be left
to the punishment inflicted by Mr. M&uuml;ller. On the
other hand, students who regard the growth of the
idea of power, which is the predicate of every fetich,
as a slow process, as the result of various impressions
and trains of early half-conscious reasoning, cannot
be disposed of by the charge that they think that
&lsquo;every human being was miraculously endowed&rsquo;
with any concept whatever. They, at least, will
agree with Mr. Max M&uuml;ller that there are fetiches
and fetiches, that to one reverence is assigned for one
reason, to another for another. Unfortunately, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
less easy to admit that Mr. Max M&uuml;ller has been
happy in his choice of ancient instances. He writes
(p. 99): &lsquo;Sometimes a stock or a stone was worshipped
because it was a forsaken altar or an ancient place
of judgment, sometimes because it marked the place
of a great battle or a murder, or the burial of a
king.&rsquo; Here he refers to Pausanias, book i. 28, 5,
and viii. 13, 2.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> In both of these passages, Pausanias,
it is true, mentions stones&mdash;in the first passage
stones on which men stood <ins class="greek" title="hosoi dikas hypechousi kai
hoi di&ocirc;kontes">&#8005;&#963;&#959;&#953; &#948;&#8055;&#954;&#945;&#962; &#8017;&#960;&#8051;&#967;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#7985; &#948;&#953;&#8061;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</ins>, in the second, barrows heaped up in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
honour of men who fell in battle. In neither case,
however, do I find anything to show that the stones
were worshipped. These stones, then, have no more
to do with the argument than the milestones which
certainly exist on the Dover road, but which are not
the objects of superstitious reverence. No! the fetich-stones
of Greece were those which occupied the holy
of holies of the most ancient temples, the mysterious
fanes within dark cedar or cypress groves, to which
men were hardly admitted. They were the stones
and blocks which bore the names of gods, Hera, or
Apollo, names perhaps given, as De Brosses says,
to the old fetichistic objects of worship, <em>after</em> the
anthropomorphic gods entered Hellas. This, at
least, is the natural conclusion from the fact that the
Apollo and Hera of untouched wood or stone were
confessedly the <em>oldest</em>. Religion, possessing an old
fetich, did not incur the risk of breaking the run of
luck by discarding it, but wisely retained and renamed
it. Mr. Max M&uuml;ller says that the unhewn
lump may indicate a higher power of abstraction than
the worship paid to the work of Phidias; but in that
case all the savage adorers of rough stones <em>may</em> be
in a stage of more abstract thought than these contemporaries
of Phidias who had such very hard
work to make Greek thought abstract.</p>

<p>Mr. M&uuml;ller founds a very curious argument on
what he calls &lsquo;the ubiquity of fetichism.&rsquo; Like De
Brosses, he compiles (from Pausanias) a list of the
rude stones worshipped by the early Greeks. He
mentions various examples of fetichistic superstitions
in Rome. He detects the fetichism of popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
Catholicism, and of Russian orthodoxy among the
peasants. Here, he cries, in religions the history of
which is known to us, fetichism is secondary, &lsquo;and
why should fetiches in Africa, where we do not know
the earlier development of religion, be considered as
primary?&rsquo; What a singular argument! According
to Pausanias, this fetichism (if fetichism it is) <em>was</em>
primary, in Greece. The <em>oldest</em> temples, in their
holiest place, held the oldest fetich. In Rome, it is at
least probable that fetichism, as in Greece, was partly
a survival, partly a new growth from the primal root
of human superstitions. As to Catholicism, the
records of Councils, the invectives of the Church,
show us that, from the beginning, the secondary
religion in point of time, the religion of the Church,
laboured vainly to suppress, and had in part to tolerate,
the primary religion of childish superstitions.
The documents are before the world. As to the
Russians, the history of their conversion is pretty
well known. Jaroslaf, or Vladimir, or some other
evangelist, had whole villages baptised in groups, and
the pagan peasants naturally kept up their primary
semi-savage ways of thought and worship, under
the secondary varnish of orthodoxy. In all Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s examples, then, fetichism turns out to be <em>primary</em>
in point of time; <em>secondary</em> only, as subordinate
to some later development of faith, or to some lately
superimposed religion. Accepting his statement that
fetichism is ubiquitous, we have the most powerful
<i>&agrave; priori</i> argument that fetichism is primitive. As
religions become developed they are differentiated; it
is only fetichism that you find the same everywhere.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
Thus the bow and arrow have a wide range of distribution:
the musket, one not so wide; the Martini-Henry
rifle, a still narrower range: it is the primitive stone
weapons that are ubiquitous, that are found in the
soil of England, Egypt, America, France, Greece, as
in the hands of Dieyries and Admiralty Islanders.
And just as rough stone knives are earlier than iron
ones (though the same race often uses both), so
fetichism is more primitive than higher and purer
faiths, though the same race often combines fetichism
and theism. No one will doubt the truth of this
where weapons are concerned; but Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
will not look at religion in this way.</p>

<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s remarks on &lsquo;Zoolatry,&rsquo; as De
Brosses calls it, or animal-worship, require only the
briefest comment. De Brosses, very unluckily, confused
zoolatry with other superstitions under the head
of Fetichism. This was unscientific; but is it scientific
of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller to discuss animal-worship
without any reference to totemism? The worship
of sacred animals is found, in every part of the globe,
to be part of the sanction of the most stringent and
important of all laws, the laws of marriage. It is an
historical truth that the society of Ashantees, Choctaws,
Australians, is actually constructed by the
operation of laws which are under the sanction of
various sacred plants and animals.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> There is scarcely
a race so barbarous that these laws are not traceable
at work in its society, nor a people (especially
an ancient people) so cultivated that its laws and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
religion are not full of strange facts most easily
explained as relics of totemism. Now note that
actual living totemism is always combined with the
rudest ideas of marriage, with almost repulsive ideas
about the family. Presumably, this rudeness is
earlier than culture, and therefore this form of animal-worship
is one of the earliest religions that we know.
The almost limitless distribution of the phenomena,
their regular development, their gradual disappearance,
all point to the fact that they are all very early
and everywhere produced by similar causes.</p>

<p>Of all these facts, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller only mentions
one&mdash;that many races have called themselves Snakes,
and he thinks they might naturally adopt the snake
for ancestor, and finally for god. He quotes the
remark of Diodorus that &lsquo;the snake may either have
been made a god because he was figured on the
banners, or may have been figured on the banners
because he was a god&rsquo;; to which De Brosses, with
his usual sense, rejoins: &lsquo;We represent saints on our
banners because we revere them; we do not revere
them because we represent them on our banners.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In a discussion about origins, and about the corruption
of religion, it would have been well to account
for institutions and beliefs almost universally distributed.
We know, what De Brosses did not, that
zoolatry is inextricably blent with laws and customs
which surely must be early, if not primitive, because
they make the working faith of societies in which
male descent and the modern family are not yet
established. Any one who wishes to show that this
sort of society is a late corruption, not an early stage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
in evolution towards better things, has a difficult task
before him, which, however, he must undertake, before
he can prove zoolatry to be a corruption of religion.</p>

<p>As to the worship of ancestral and embodied
human spirits, which (it has been so plausibly argued)
is the first moment in religion, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller dismisses
it, here, in eleven lines and a half. An isolated
but important allusion at the close of his lectures will
be noticed in its place.</p>

<p>The end of the polemic against the primitiveness
of fetichism deals with the question, &lsquo;Whence comes
the supernatural predicate of the fetich?&rsquo; If a negro
tells us his fetich is a god, whence got he the idea of
&lsquo;god&rsquo;? Many obvious answers occur. Mr. M&uuml;ller
says, speaking of the Indians (p. 205): &lsquo;The concept
of <em>gods</em> was no doubt growing up while men were
assuming a more and more definite attitude towards
these semi-tangible and intangible objects&rsquo;&mdash;trees,
rivers, hills, the sky, the sun, and so on, which he
thinks suggested and developed, by aid of a kind of
awe, the religious feeling of the infinite. We too
would say that, among people who adore fetiches and
ghosts, the concept of gods no doubt silently grew
up, as men assumed a more and more definite attitude
towards the tangible and intangible objects they held
sacred. Again, negroes have had the idea of god
imported among them by Christians and Islamites,
so that, even if they did not climb (as De Brosses
grants that many of them do) to purer religious ideas
unaided, these ideas are now familiar to them, and
may well be used by them, when they have to explain
a fetich to a European. Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
explains the origin of religion by a term (&lsquo;the
Infinite&rsquo;) which, he admits, the early people would
not have comprehended. The negro, if he tells a
white man that a fetich is a god, transposes terms in
the same unscientific way. Mr. M&uuml;ller asks: &lsquo;How
do these people, when they have picked up their stone
or their shell, pick up, at the same time, the concepts
of a supernatural power, of spirit, of god, and of
worship paid to some unseen being?&rsquo; But who says
that men picked up these ideas <em>at the same time</em>?
These ideas were evolved by a long, slow, complicated
process. It is not at all impossible that the idea of
a kind of &lsquo;luck&rsquo; attached to this or that object, was
evolved by dint of meditating on a mere series of
lucky accidents. Such or such a man, having found
such an object, succeeded in hunting, fishing, or war.
By degrees, similar objects might be believed to
command success. Thus burglars carry bits of coal
in their pockets, &lsquo;for luck.&rsquo; This random way of
connecting causes and effects which have really no
inter-relation, is a common error of early reasoning.
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller says that &lsquo;this process of reasoning
is far more in accordance with modern thought&rsquo;; if
so, modern thought has little to be proud of. Herodotus,
however, describes the process of thought as
consecrated by custom among the Egyptians. But
there are many other practical ways in which the
idea of supernatural power is attached to fetiches.
Some fetich-stones have a superficial resemblance to
other objects, and thus (on the magical system of
reasoning) are thought to influence these objects.
Others, again, are pointed out as worthy of regard in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
dreams or by the ghosts of the dead.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> To hold these
views of the origin of the supernatural predicate of
fetiches is not &lsquo;to take for granted that every human
being was miraculously endowed with the concept
of what forms the predicate of every fetich.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thus we need not be convinced by Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller that fetichism (though it necessarily has its
antecedents in the human mind) is &lsquo;a corruption of
religion.&rsquo; It still appears to be one of the most
primitive steps towards the idea of the supernatural.</p>

<p>What, then, is the subjective element of religion
in man? How has he become capable of conceiving of
the supernatural? What outward objects first awoke
that dormant faculty in his breast? Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
answers, that man has &lsquo;the faculty of apprehending
the infinite&rsquo;&mdash;that by dint of this faculty he is capable
of religion, and that sensible objects, &lsquo;tangible, semi-tangible,
intangible,&rsquo; first roused the faculty to religious
activity, at least among the natives of India.
He means, however, by the &lsquo;infinite&rsquo; which savages
apprehend, not our metaphysical conception of the
infinite, but the mere impression that there is &lsquo;something
beyond.&rsquo; &lsquo;Everything of which his senses
cannot perceive a limit, is to a primitive savage or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
to any man in an early stage of intellectual activity
<em>unlimited</em> or <em>infinite</em>.&rsquo; Thus, in all experience, the
idea of &lsquo;a beyond&rsquo; is forced on men. If Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller would adhere to this theory, then we should
suppose him to mean (what we hold to be more or
less true) that savage religion, like savage science, is
merely a fanciful explanation of what lies beyond
the horizon of experience. For example, if the Australians
mentioned by Mr. Max M&uuml;ller believe in
a being who created the world, a being whom they
do not worship, and to whom they pay no regard
(for, indeed, he has become &lsquo;decrepit&rsquo;), their theory
is scientific, not religious. They have looked for the
causes of things, and are no more religious (in so
doing) than Newton was when he worked out his
theory of gravitation. The term &lsquo;infinite&rsquo; is wrongly
applied, because it is a term of advanced thought
used in explanation of the ideas of men who, Mr.
Max M&uuml;ller says, were incapable of conceiving the
meaning of such a concept. Again, it is wrongly
applied, because it has some modern religious associations,
which are covertly and fallaciously introduced
to explain the supposed emotions of early men.
Thus, Mr. M&uuml;ller says (p. 177)&mdash;he is giving his
account of the material things that awoke the religious
faculty&mdash;&lsquo;the mere sight of the torrent or the
stream would have been enough to call forth in the
hearts of the early dwellers on the earth ... a
feeling that they were surrounded on all sides by
powers invisible, infinite, or divine.&rsquo; Here, if I understand
Mr. M&uuml;ller, &lsquo;infinite&rsquo; is used in our modern
sense. The question is, How did men ever come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
to believe in powers infinite, invisible, divine? If
Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s words mean anything, they mean that
a dormant feeling that there were such existences
lay in the breast of man, and was wakened into
active and conscious life, by the sight of a torrent
or a stream. How, to use Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s own manner,
did these people, when they saw a stream, have mentally,
at the same time, &lsquo;a feeling of <em>infinite</em> powers&rsquo;?
If this is not the expression of a theory of &lsquo;innate
religion&rsquo; (a theory which Mr. M&uuml;ller disclaims), it
is capable of being mistaken for that doctrine by
even a careful reader. The feeling of &lsquo;powers infinite,
invisible, divine,&rsquo; <em>must</em> be in the heart, or the
mere sight of a river could not call it forth. How did
the feeling get into the heart? That is the question.</p>

<p>The ordinary anthropologist distinguishes a multitude
of causes, a variety of processes, which shade
into each other and gradually produce the belief in
powers invisible, infinite, and divine. What tribe
is unacquainted with dreams, visions, magic, the
apparitions of the dead? Add to these the slow
action of thought, the conjectural inferences, the
guesses of crude metaphysics, the theories of isolated
men of religious and speculative genius. By all these
and other forces manifold, that emotion of awe in
presence of the hills, the stars, the sea, is developed.
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller cuts the matter shorter. The early
inhabitants of the earth saw a river, and the &lsquo;mere
sight&rsquo; of the torrent called forth the feelings which
(to us) seem to demand ages of the operation of causes
disregarded by Mr. M&uuml;ller in his account of the origin
of Indian religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
The mainspring of Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s doctrine is his
theory about &lsquo;apprehending the infinite.&rsquo; Early
religion, or at least that of India, was, in his view,
the extension of an idea of Vastness, a disinterested
emotion of awe.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Elsewhere, we think, early religion
has been a development of ideas of Force, an interested
search, not for something wide and far and
hard to conceive, but for something practically <em>strong</em>
for good and evil. Mr. M&uuml;ller (taking no count in this
place of fetiches, ghosts, dreams and magic) explains
that the sense of &lsquo;wonderment&rsquo; was wakened by
objects only semi-tangible, trees, which are <em>taller</em> than
we are, &lsquo;whose roots are beyond our reach, and which
have a kind of life in them.&rsquo; &lsquo;We are dealing with
a quartenary, it may be a tertiary troglodyte,&rsquo; says
Mr. M&uuml;ller. If a tertiary troglodyte was like a modern
Andaman Islander, a Kaneka, a Dieyrie, would he
stand and meditate in awe on the fact that a tree
was taller than he, or had &lsquo;a kind of life,&rsquo; &lsquo;an unknown
and unknowable, yet undeniable something&rsquo;?<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
Why, this is the sentiment of modern Germany, and
perhaps of the Indian sages of a cultivated period!
A troglodyte would look for a &rsquo;possum in the tree,
he would tap the trunk for honey, he would poke
about in the bark after grubs, or he would worship
anything odd in the branches. Is Mr. M&uuml;ller not
unconsciously transporting a kind of modern malady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
of thought into the midst of people who wanted
to find a dinner, and who might worship a tree if it
had a grotesque shape, that, for them, had a magical
meaning, or if <i>boilyas</i> lived in its boughs, but whose
practical way of dealing with the problem of its life
was to burn it round the stem, chop the charred
wood with stone axes, and use the bark, branches,
and leaves as they happened to come handy?</p>

<p>Mr. M&uuml;ller has a long list of semi-tangible objects
&lsquo;overwhelming and overawing,&rsquo; like the tree. There
are mountains, where &lsquo;even a stout heart shivers
before the real presence of the <em>infinite</em>&rsquo;; there are
rivers, those instruments of so sudden a religious
awakening; there is earth. These supply the material
for semi-deities. Then come sky, stars, dawn, sun
and moon: &lsquo;in these we have the germs of what, hereafter,
we shall have to call by the name of deities.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Before we can transmute, with Mr. M&uuml;ller, these
objects of a somewhat vague religious regard into a
kind of gods, we have to adopt Noir&eacute;&rsquo;s philological
theories, and study the effects of auxiliary verbs on
the development of personification and of religion.
Noir&eacute;&rsquo;s philological theories are still, I presume, under
discussion. They are necessary, however, to Mr.
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s doctrine of the development of the vague
&lsquo;sense of the infinite&rsquo; (wakened by fine old trees,
and high mountains) into <i>devas</i>, and of <i>devas</i> (which
means &lsquo;shining ones&rsquo;) into the Vedic gods. Our
troglodyte ancestors, and their sweet feeling for the
spiritual aspect of landscape, are thus brought into
relation with the Rishis of the Vedas, the sages and
poets of a pleasing civilisation. The reverence felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
for such comparatively refined or remote things as
fire, the sun, wind, thunder, the dawn, furnished a
series of stepping-stones to the Vedic theology, if
theology it can be called. It is impossible to give
each step in detail; the process must be studied in
Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s lectures. Nor can we discuss the later
changes of faith. As to the processes which produced
the fetichistic &lsquo;corruption&rsquo; (that universal and
everywhere identical form of decay), Mr. M&uuml;ller does
not afford even a hint. He only says that, when the
Indians found that their old gods were mere names,
&lsquo;they built out of the scattered bricks a new altar to
the Unknown God&rsquo;&mdash;a statement which throws no
light on the parasitical development of fetichism.
But his whole theory is deficient if, having called
fetichism a <em>corruption</em>, he does not show how corruption
arose, how it operated, and how the disease
attacked all religions everywhere.</p>

<p>We have contested, step by step, many of Mr.
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s propositions. If space permitted, it would
be interesting to examine the actual attitude of certain
contemporary savages, Bushmen and others, towards
the sun. Contemporary savages may be degraded,
they certainly are not primitive, but their <em>legends</em>, at
least, are the oldest things they possess. The supernatural
elements in their ideas about the sun are
curiously unlike those which, according to Mr.
M&uuml;ller, entered into the development of Aryan
religion.</p>

<p>The last remark which has to be made about Mr.
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s scheme of the development of Aryan religion
is that the religion, as explained by him, does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
not apparently aid the growth of society, nor work
with it in any way. Let us look at a sub-barbaric
society&mdash;say that of Zululand, of New Zealand,
of the Iroquois League, or at a savage society
like that of the Kanekas, or of those Australian
tribes about whom we have very many interesting
and copious accounts. If we begin with the Australians,
we observe that society is based on certain
laws of marriage enforced by capital punishment.
These laws of marriage forbid the intermixing of
persons belonging to the stock which worships this
or that animal, or plant. Now this rule, as already
observed, <em>made</em> the &lsquo;gentile&rsquo; system (as Mr. Morgan
erroneously calls it) the system which gradually reduces
tribal hostility, by making tribes homogeneous.
The same system (with the religious sanction of a
kind of zoolatry) is in force and has worked to
the same result, in Africa, Asia, America, and Australia,
while a host of minute facts make it a
reasonable conclusion that it prevailed in Europe.
Among these facts certain peculiarities of Greek and
Roman and Hindoo marriage law, Greek, Latin, and
English tribal names, and a crowd of legends are the
most prominent.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s doctrine of the
development of Indian religion (while admitting the
existence of Snake or Naga tribes) takes no account
of the action of this universal zoolatry on religion and
society.</p>

<p>After marriage and after tribal institutions, look
at <em>rank</em>. Is it not obvious that the religious elements
(magic and necromancy) left out of his reckoning by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
Mr. M&uuml;ller are most powerful in developing rank?
Even among those democratic paupers, the Fuegians,
&lsquo;the doctor-wizard of each party has much influence
over his companions.&rsquo; Among those other democrats,
the Eskimo, a class of wizards, called Angakuts,
become &lsquo;a kind of civil magistrates,&rsquo; because they can
cause fine weather, and can magically detect people
who commit offences. Thus the germs of rank, in
these cases, are sown by the magic which is fetichism
in action. Try the Zulus: &lsquo;the heaven is the chief&rsquo;s,&rsquo;
he can call up clouds and storms, hence the sanction
of his authority. In New Zealand, every Rangatira
has a supernatural power. If he touches an article,
no one else dares to appropriate it, for fear of terrible
supernatural consequences. A head chief is &lsquo;tapued
an inch thick, and perfectly unapproachable.&rsquo; Magical
power abides in and emanates from him. By this
superstition, an aristocracy is formed, and property
(the property, at least, of the aristocracy) is secured.
Among the Red Indians, as Schoolcraft says, &lsquo;priests
and jugglers are the persons that make war and have
a voice in the sale of the land.&rsquo; Mr. E.&nbsp;W. Robertson
says much the same thing about early Scotland.
If Odin was not a god with the gifts of a medicine-man,
and did not owe his chiefship to his talent for
dealing with magic, he is greatly maligned. The
Irish Brehons also sanctioned legal decisions by
magical devices, afterwards condemned by the Church.
Among the Zulus, &lsquo;the <i>Itongo</i> (spirit) dwells with the
great man; he who dreams is the chief of the village.&rsquo;
The chief alone can &lsquo;read in the vessel of divination.&rsquo;
The Kaneka chiefs are medicine-men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
Here then, in widely distant regions, in early
European, American, Melanesian, African societies,
we find those factors in religion which the primitive
Aryans are said to have dispensed with, helping to
construct society, rank, property. Is it necessary to
add that the ancestral spirits still &lsquo;rule the present
from the past,&rsquo; and demand sacrifice, and speak to
&lsquo;him who dreams,&rsquo; who, therefore, is a strong force in
society, if not a chief? Mr. Herbert Spencer, Mr.
Tylor, M. Fustel de Coulanges, a dozen others, have
made all this matter of common notoriety. As
Hearne the traveller says about the Copper River
Indians, &lsquo;it is almost necessary that they who rule
them should profess something a little supernatural
to enable them to deal with the people.&rsquo; The few
examples we have given show how widely, and among
what untutored races, the need is felt. The rudimentary
government of early peoples requires, and, by aid
of dreams, necromancy, &lsquo;medicine&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, fetiches),
<i>tapu</i>, and so forth, obtains, a supernatural sanction.</p>

<p>Where is the supernatural sanction that consecrated
the chiefs of a race which woke to the sense of
the existence of infinite beings, in face of trees, rivers,
the dawn, the sun, and had none of the so-called late
and corrupt fetichism that does such useful social
work?</p>

<p>To the student of other early societies, Mr.
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s theory of the growth of Aryan religion seems
to leave society without cement, and without the most
necessary sanctions. One man is as good as another,
before a tree, a river, a hill. The savage organisers
of other societies found out fetiches and ghosts that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
were &lsquo;respecters of persons.&rsquo; Zoolatry is intertwisted
with the earliest and most widespread law of prohibited
degrees. How did the Hindoos dispense with
the aid of these superstitions? Well, they did not
quite dispense with them. Mr. Max M&uuml;ller remarks,
almost on his last page (376), that &lsquo;in India also ...
the thoughts and feelings about those whom death
had separated from us for a time, supplied some of
the earliest and most important elements of religion.&rsquo;
If this was the case, surely the presence of those
elements and their influence should have been indicated
along with the remarks about the awfulness of
trees and the suggestiveness of rivers. Is nothing
said about the spirits of the dead and their cult in the
Vedas? Much is said, of course. But, were it otherwise,
then other elements of savage religion may also
have been neglected there, and it will be impossible
to argue that fetichism did not exist because it is not
mentioned. It will also be impossible to admit that
the <i>Hibbert Lectures</i> give more than a one-sided
account of the Origin of Indian Religion.</p>

<p>The perusal of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s book deeply
impresses one with the necessity of studying early
religions and early societies simultaneously. If it be
true that early Indian religion lacked precisely those
superstitions, so childish, so grotesque, and yet so
useful, which we find at work in contemporary tribes,
and which we read of in history, the discovery is even
more remarkable and important than the author
of the <i>Hibbert Lectures</i> seems to suppose. It is
scarcely necessary to repeat that the negative evidence
of the Vedas, the religious utterances of sages,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
made in a time of what we might call &lsquo;heroic culture,&rsquo;
can never disprove the existence of superstitions
which, if current in the former experience of the race,
the hymnists, as Barth observes, would intentionally
ignore. Our object has been to defend the &lsquo;primitiveness
of fetichism.&rsquo; By this we do not mean to
express any opinion as to whether fetichism (in the
strictest sense of the word) was or was not earlier
than totemism, than the worship of the dead, or
than the involuntary sense of awe and terror with
which certain vast phenomena may have affected
the earliest men. We only claim for the powerful
and ubiquitous practices of fetichism a place <em>among</em>
the early elements of religion, and insist that what
is so universal has not yet been shown to be &lsquo;a corruption&rsquo;
of something older and purer.</p>

<p>One remark of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s fortifies these
opinions. If fetichism be indeed one of the earliest
factors of faith in the supernatural; if it be, in its
rudest forms, most powerful in proportion to other
elements of faith among the least cultivated races
(and <em>that</em> Mr. M&uuml;ller will probably allow)&mdash;among
what class of cultivated peoples will it longest hold
its ground? Clearly, among the least cultivated,
among the fishermen, the shepherds of lonely districts,
the peasants of outlying lands&mdash;in short,
among the <em>people</em>. Neglected by sacred poets in the
culminating period of purity in religion, it will linger
among the superstitions of the rustics. There is no
real break in the continuity of peasant life; the
modern folklore is (in many points) the savage
ritual. Now Mr. M&uuml;ller, when he was minimising the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
existence of fetichism in the Rig Veda (the oldest
collection of hymns), admitted its existence in the
&Acirc;tharva<i>n</i>a (p. 60).<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> On p. 151, we read &lsquo;the Atharva-veda-Sanhita
is a later collection, containing, besides
a large number of Rig Veda verses, <em>some curious relics
of popular poetry connected with charms, imprecations,
and other superstitious usages</em>.&rsquo; The italics are mine,
and are meant to emphasise this fact:&mdash;When we
leave the sages, the Rishis, and look at what is
<em>popular</em>, look at what that class believed which of
savage practice has everywhere retained so much, we
are at once among the charms and the fetiches! This
is precisely what one would have expected. If the
history of religion and of mythology is to be unravelled,
we must examine what the unprogressive
classes in Europe have in common with Australians
and Bushmen, and Andaman Islanders. It is the
function of the people to retain in folklore these
elements of religion, which it is the high duty of the
sage and the poet to purify away in the fire of refining
thought. It is for this very reason that <em>ritual</em>
has (though Mr. Max M&uuml;ller curiously says that it
seems not to possess) an immense scientific interest.
Ritual holds on, with the tenacity of superstition, to
all that has ever been practised. Yet, when Mr.
M&uuml;ller wants to know about <em>origins</em>, about actual
ancient <em>practice</em>, he deliberately turns to that &lsquo;great
collection of ancient poetry&rsquo; (the Rig Veda) &lsquo;which
has no special reference to sacrificial acts,&rsquo; not to the
Brahmanas which are full of ritual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
To sum up briefly:&mdash;(1) Mr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s arguments
against the evidence for, and the primitiveness of,
fetichism seem to demonstrate the opposite of that
which he intends them to prove. (2) His own evidence
for <em>primitive</em> practice is chosen from the documents
of a <em>cultivated</em> society. (3) His theory deprives
that society of the very influences which have elsewhere
helped the Tribe, the Family, Rank, and
Priesthoods to grow up, and to form the backbone of
social existence.</p>

A third reference to Pausanias I have been unable to verify.
There are several references to Greek fetich-stones in Theophrastus&rsquo;
account of the Superstitious Man. A number of Greek sacred stones
named by Pausanias may be worth noticing. In B&oelig;otia (ix. 16), the
people believed that Alcmene, mother of Heracles, was changed into
a stone. The Thespians worshipped, under the name of Eros, an
unwrought stone, <ins class="greek" title="agalma palaiotaton">&#7940;&#947;&#945;&#955;&#956;&#945; &#960;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#8057;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#957;</ins>, &lsquo;their most ancient sacred
object&rsquo; (ix. 27). The people of Orchomenos &lsquo;paid extreme regard to
certain stones,&rsquo; said to have fallen from heaven, &lsquo;or to certain figures
made of stone that descended from the sky&rsquo; (ix. 38). Near Ch&aelig;ronea
Rhea was said to have deceived Cronus, by offering him, in place of
Zeus, a stone wrapped in swaddling bands. This stone, which Cronus
vomited forth after having swallowed it, was seen by Pausanias at
Delphi (ix. 41). By the roadside, near the city of the Panopeans, lay the
stones out of which Prometheus made men (x. 4). The stone swallowed
in place of Zeus by his father lay at the exit from the Delphian temple
and was anointed (compare the action of Jacob, Gen. xxviii. 18) with
oil every day. The Phocians worshipped thirty squared stones, each
named after a god (vii. xxii.). &lsquo;<em>Among all the Greeks rude stones were
worshipped before the images of the gods.</em>&rsquo; Among the Tr&oelig;zenians a
sacred stone lay in front of the temple, whereon the Tr&oelig;zenian elders
sat, and purified Orestes from the murder of his mother. In Attica
there was a conical stone worshipped as Apollo (i. xliv.). Near Argos
was a stone called Zeus Cappotas, on which Orestes was said to have
sat down, and so recovered peace of mind. Such are examples of the
sacred stones, the oldest worshipful objects, of Greece.</p>

Here I may mention a case illustrating the motives of the fetich-worshipper.
My friend, Mr. J.&nbsp;J. Atkinson, who has for many years
studied the manners of the people of New Caledonia, asked a native
<em>why</em> he treasured a certain fetich stone. The man replied that, in one
of the vigils which are practised beside the corpses of deceased friends,
he saw a lizard. The lizard is a totem, a worshipful animal in New
Caledonia. The native put out his hand to touch it, when it disappeared
and left a stone in its place. This stone he therefore held
sacred in the highest degree. Here then a fetich-stone was indicated
as such by a spirit in form of a lizard.</p>

<h3><i>THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE
FAMILY.</i></h3>


<p>What are the original forms of the human family?
Did man begin by being monogamous or polygamous,
but, in either case, the master of his own home and
the assured central point of his family relations? Or
were the unions of the sexes originally shifting and
precarious, so that the wisest child was not expected
to know his own father, and family ties were reckoned
through the mother alone? Again (setting aside the
question of what was &lsquo;primitive&rsquo; and &lsquo;original&rsquo;), did
the needs and barbarous habits of early men lead to
a scarcity of women, and hence to polyandry (that
is, the marriage of one woman to several men), with
the consequent uncertainty about male parentage?
Once more, admitting that these loose and strange
relations of the sexes do prevail, or have prevailed,
among savages, is there any reason to suppose that
the stronger races, the Aryan and Semitic stocks,
ever passed through this stage of savage customs?
These are the main questions debated between what
we may call the &lsquo;historical&rsquo; and the &lsquo;anthropological&rsquo;
students of ancient customs.</p>

<p>When Sir Henry Maine observed, in 1861, that it
was difficult to say what society of men had <em>not been</em>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
originally, based on the patriarchal family, he went, of
course, outside the domain of history. What occurred
in the very origin of human society is a question
perhaps quite inscrutable. Certainly, history cannot
furnish the answer. Here the anthropologist and
physiologist come in with their methods, and even
those, we think, can throw but an uncertain light
on the very &lsquo;origin&rsquo; of institutions, and on strictly
primitive man.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this discussion, we shall here
re-state the chief points at issue between the adherents
of Sir Henry Maine and of Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan, between
historical and anthropological inquirers.</p>

<p>1. Did man <em>originally</em> live in the patriarchal
family, or did he live in more or less modified promiscuity,
with uncertainty of blood-ties, and especially
of male parentage?</p>

<p>2. Did circumstances and customs at some time
compel or induce man (whatever his <em>original</em> condition)
to resort to practices which made paternity
uncertain, and so caused kinship to be reckoned
through women?</p>

<p>3. Granting that some races have been thus
reduced to matriarchal forms of the family&mdash;that is,
to forms in which the woman is the permanent recognised
centre&mdash;is there any reason to suppose that the
stronger peoples, like the Aryans and the Semites, ever
passed through a stage of culture in which female, not
male, kinship was chiefly recognised, probably as a
result of polyandry, of many husbands to one wife?</p>

<p>On this third question, it will be necessary to
produce much evidence of very different sorts:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
evidence which, at best, can perhaps only warrant
an inference, or presumption, in favour of one or the
other opinion. For the moment, the impartial examination
of testimony is more important and practicable
than the establishment of any theory.</p>

<p>(1) Did man <em>originally</em> live in the patriarchal
family, the male being master of his female mate or
mates, and of his children? On this first point Sir
Henry Maine, in his new volume,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> may be said to come
as near proving his case as the nature and matter
of the question will permit. Bachofen, M&lsquo;Lennan,
and Morgan, all started from a hypothetical state
of more or less modified sexual promiscuity. Bachofen&rsquo;s
evidence (which may be referred to later) was
based on a great mass of legends, myths, and
travellers&rsquo; tales, chiefly about early Aryan practices.
He discovered <i>Het&auml;rismus</i>, as he called it, or promiscuity,
among Lydians, Etruscans, Persians, Thracians,
Cyrenian nomads, Egyptians, Scythians, Troglodytes,
Nasamones, and so forth. Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan&rsquo;s view is,
perhaps, less absolutely stated than Sir Henry Maine
supposes. M&lsquo;Lennan says<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> &lsquo;that there has been a
stage in the development of the human races, when
there was no such appropriation of women to particular
men; when, in short, marriage, <em>as it exists among
civilised nations</em>, was not practised. Marriage, <em>in this
sense</em>, was yet undreamt of.&rsquo; Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan adds
(pp. 130, 131), &lsquo;as among other gregarious animals,
the unions of the sexes were probably, in the earliest
times, loose, transitory, and, <em>in some degree</em>, promiscuous.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
Sir Henry Maine opposes to Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan&rsquo;s
theory the statement of Mr. Darwin: &lsquo;From all we
know of the passions of all male quadrupeds, promiscuous
intercourse in a state of Nature is highly
improbable.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> On this first question, let us grant to Sir
Henry Maine, to Mr. Darwin, and to common-sense
that if the very earliest men were extremely animal
in character, their unions while they lasted were
probably monogamous or polygamous. The sexual
jealousy of the male would secure that result, as it does
among many other animals. Let the first point, then,
be scored to Sir Henry Maine: let it be granted that
if man was created perfect, he lived in the monogamous
family before the Fall: and that, if he was evolved as
an animal, the unchecked animal instincts would make
for monogamy or patriarchal polygamy in the strictly
primitive family.</p>

<p>(2) Did circumstances and customs ever or anywhere
compel or induce man (whatever his original
condition) to resort to practices which made paternity
uncertain, and so caused the absence of the patriarchal
family, kinship being reckoned through women? If
this question be answered in the affirmative, and if the
sphere of action of the various causes be made wide
enough, it will not matter much to Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan&rsquo;s
theory whether the strictly primitive family was
patriarchal or not. If there occurred a fall from the
primitive family, and if that fall was extremely general,
affecting even the Aryan race, Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan&rsquo;s adherents
will be amply satisfied. Their object is to show
that the family, even in the Aryan race, was developed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
through a stage of loose savage connections. If that
can be shown, they do not care much about primitive
man properly so called. Sir Henry Maine admits, as
a matter of fact, that among certain races, in certain
districts, circumstances have overridden the sexual
jealousy which secures the recognition of male parentage.
Where women have been few, and where
poverty has been great, jealousy has been suppressed,
even in the Venice of the eighteenth century. Sir H.
Maine says: &lsquo;The usage&rsquo; (that of polyandry&mdash;many
husbands to a single wife) &lsquo;seems to me one which circumstances
overpowering morality and decency might
at any time call into existence. It is known to have
arisen in the native Indian army.&rsquo; The question now
is, what are the circumstances that overpower morality
and decency, and so produce polyandry, with its
necessary consequences, when it is a recognised
institution&mdash;the absence of the patriarchal family,
and the recognition of kinship through women? Any
circumstances which cause great scarcity of women
will conduce to those results. Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan&rsquo;s opinion
was, that the chief cause of scarcity of women has
been the custom of female infanticide&mdash;of killing little
girls as <i>bouches inutiles</i>. Sir Henry Maine admits
that &lsquo;the cause assigned by M&lsquo;Lennan is a <i>vera
causa</i>&mdash;it is capable of producing the effects.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Mr.
M&lsquo;Lennan collected a very large mass of testimony
to prove the wide existence of this cause of paucity
of women. Till that evidence is published, I can
only say that it was sufficient, in Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan&rsquo;s
opinion, to demonstrate the wide prevalence of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
factor which is the mainspring of his whole system.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
How frightfully female infanticide has prevailed in
India, every one may read in the official reports of
Col. M&lsquo;Pherson, and other English authorities. Mr.
Fison&rsquo;s <i>Kamilaroi and Kurnai</i> contains some notable,
though not to my mind convincing, arguments on
the other side. Sir Henry Maine adduces another
cause of paucity of women: the wanderings of our
race, and expeditions across sea.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> This cause would
not, however, be important enough to alter forms of
kinship, where the invaders (like the early English in
Britain) found a population which they could conquer
and whose women they could appropriate.</p>

<p>Apart from any probable inferences that may be
drawn from the presumed practice of female infanticide,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
actual ascertained facts prove that many races do
not now live, or that recently they did not live, in the
patriarchal or modern family. They live, or did live,
in polyandrous associations. The Thibetans, the Nairs,
the early inhabitants of Britain (according to C&aelig;sar),
and many other races,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> as well as the inhabitants
of the Marquesas Islands, and the Iroquois (according
to Lafitau), practise, or have practised, polyandry.</p>

<p>We now approach the third and really important
problem&mdash;(3) Is there any reason to suppose that
the stronger peoples, like the Aryans and the Semites,
ever passed through a stage of culture in which female,
not male, kinship was chiefly recognised, probably as
a result of polyandry?</p>

<p>Now the nature of the evidence which affords a
presumption that Aryans have all passed through
Australian institutions, such as polyandry, is of
extremely varied character. Much of it may undoubtedly
be explained away. But such strength as
the evidence has (which we do not wish to exaggerate)
is derived from its convergence to one point&mdash;namely,
the anterior existence of polyandry and the matriarchal
family among Aryans before and after the
dawn of real history.</p>

<p>For the sake of distinctness we may here number
the heads of the evidence bearing on this question.
We have&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The evidence of inference from the form of
capture in bridal ceremonies.</p>

<p>2. The evidence from exogamy: the law which forbids
marriage between persons of the same family name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
3. The evidence from totemism&mdash;that is, the derivation
of the family name and crest or badge, from
some natural object, plant or animal.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Persons bearing
the name may not intermarry, nor, as a rule, may
they eat the object from which they derive their family
name and from which they claim to be descended.</p>

<p>4. The evidence from the <i>gens</i> of Rome, or <ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>
of ancient Greece, in connection with Totemism.</p>

<p>5. The evidence from myth and legend.</p>

<p>6. The evidence from direct historical statements
as to the prevalence of the matriarchal family, and
inheritance through the maternal line.</p>

<p>To take these various testimonies in their order,
let us begin with&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The form of capture in bridal ceremonies.
That this form survived in Sparta, Crete, in Hindoo
law, in the traditions of Ireland, in the popular rustic
customs of Wales, is not denied.</p>

<p>If we hold, with Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan, that scarcity of
women (produced by female infanticide or otherwise) is
the cause of the habit of capturing wives, we may see,
in survivals of this ceremony of capture among Aryans,
a proof of early scarcity of women, and of probable
polyandry. But an opponent may argue, like Mr. J.&nbsp;A.
Farrer in <i>Primitive Manners</i>, that the ceremony
of capture is mainly a concession to maiden modesty
among early races. Here one may observe that the
girls of savage tribes are notoriously profligate and
immodest about illicit connections. Only honourable
marriage brings a blush to the cheek of these young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
persons. This is odd, but, in the present state of
the question, we cannot lean on the evidence of the
ceremony of capture. We cannot demonstrate that
it is derived from a time when paucity of women
made capture of brides necessary. Thus &lsquo;honours
are easy&rsquo; in this first deal.</p>

<p>(2) The next indication is very curious, and
requires much more prolonged discussion. The custom
of <i>Exogamy</i> was first noted and named by Mr.
M&lsquo;Lennan. Exogamy is the prohibition of marriage
within the supposed blood-kinship, as denoted by the
family name. Such marriage, among many backward
races, is reckoned incestuous, and is punishable by
death. Certain peculiarities in connection with the
family name have to be noted later. Now, Sir Henry
Maine admits that exogamy, as thus defined, exists
among the Hindoos. &lsquo;A Hindoo may not marry a
woman belonging to the same <i>gotra</i>, all members of
the <i>gotra</i> being theoretically supposed to have descended
from the same ancestor.&rsquo; The same rule
prevails in China. &lsquo;There are in China large bodies
of related clansmen, each generally bearing the same
clan-name. They are exogamous; no man will
marry a woman having the same clan-name with
himself.&rsquo; It is admitted by Sir Henry Maine that
this wide prohibition of marriage was the early Aryan
rule, while advancing civilisation has gradually permitted
marriage within limits once forbidden. The
Greek Church now (according to Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan), and
the Catholic Church in the past, forbade intermarriages
&lsquo;as far as relationship could be known.&rsquo; The Hindoo
rule appears to go still further, and to prohibit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
marriage as far as the common <i>gotra</i> name seems
merely to indicate relationship.</p>

<p>As to the ancient Romans, Plutarch says: &lsquo;Formerly
they did not marry women connected with
them by blood, any more than they now marry
aunts or sisters. It was long before they would even
intermarry with cousins.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Plutarch also remarks
that, in times past, Romans did not marry <ins class="greek" title="syngenidas">&#963;&#965;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#8055;&#948;&#945;&#962;</ins>,
and if we may render this &lsquo;women of the same <i>gens</i>,&rsquo;
the exogamous prohibition in Rome was as complete
as among the Hindoos. I do not quite gather from
Sir Henry Maine&rsquo;s account of the Slavonic house
communities (pp. 254, 255) whether they dislike <em>all</em>
kindred marriages, or only marriage within the
&lsquo;greater blood&rsquo;&mdash;that is, within the kinship on the
male side. He says: &lsquo;The South Slavonians bring
their wives into the group, in which they are socially
organised, from a considerable distance outside....
Every marriage which requires an ecclesiastical dispensation
is regarded as disreputable.&rsquo;</p>

<p>On the whole, wide prohibitions of marriage are
archaic: the widest are savage; the narrowest are
modern and civilised. Thus the Hindoo prohibition
is old, barbarous and wide. &lsquo;The barbarous Aryan,&rsquo;
says Sir Henry Maine, &lsquo;is generally exogamous. He
has a most extensive table of prohibited degrees.&rsquo;
Thus exogamy seems to be a survival of barbarism.
The question for us is, Can we call exogamy a
survival from a period when (owing to scarcity of
women and polyandry) clear ideas of kinship were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
impossible? If this can be proved, exogamous
Aryans either passed through polyandrous institutions,
or borrowed a savage custom derived from a period
when ideas of kinship were obscure.</p>

<p>If we only knew the origin of the prohibition to
marry within the family name all would be plain
sailing. At present several theories of the origin of
exogamy are before the world. Mr. Morgan, the
author of <i>Ancient Society</i>, inclines to trace the
prohibition to a great early physiological discovery,
acted on by primitive men by virtue of a <i>contrat social</i>.
Early man discovered that children of unsound constitutions
were born of nearly-related parents. Mr.
Morgan says: &lsquo;Primitive men very early discovered
the evils of close interbreeding.&rsquo; Elsewhere Mr.
Morgan writes: &lsquo;Intermarriage in the <i>gens</i> was
prohibited, to secure the benefits of marrying out with
unrelated persons.&rsquo; This arrangement &lsquo;was a product
of high intelligence,&rsquo; and Mr. Morgan calls it a
&lsquo;reform.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>Let us examine this very curious theory. First:
Mr. Morgan supposes early man to have made a
discovery (the evils of the marriage of near kin) which
evades modern physiological science. Modern science
has not determined that the marriages of kinsfolk
are pernicious. Is it credible that savages should
discover a fact which puzzles science? It may
be replied that modern care, nursing, and medical
art save children of near marriages from results
which were pernicious to the children of early man.
Secondly: Mr. Morgan supposes that barbarous man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
(so notoriously reckless of the morrow as he is) not
only made the discovery of the evils of interbreeding,
but acted on it with promptitude and self-denial.
Thirdly: Mr. Morgan seems to require, for the
enforcement of the exogamous law, a <i>contrat social</i>.
The larger communities meet, and divide themselves
into smaller groups, within which wedlock is forbidden.
This &lsquo;social pact&rsquo; is like a return to the
ideas of Rousseau. Fourthly: The hypothesis credits
early men with knowledge and discrimination of
near degrees of kin, which they might well possess
if they lived in patriarchal families, but which, <i>ex
hypothesi</i>, they could not possess. But it represents
that they did not act on their knowledge. Instead
of prohibiting marriage between parents and children,
cousins, nephews and aunts, uncles and nieces, they
prohibited marriage within the limit of the name of
the kin. This is still the Hindoo rule, and, if the
Romans really might not at one time marry within
the <i>gens</i>, it was the Roman rule. Now observe, this
rule fails to effect the very purpose for which <i>ex
hypothesi</i> it was instituted. Where the family name
goes by the male side, marriages between cousins are
permitted, as in India and China. These are the
very marriages which some theorists now denounce
as pernicious. But, if the family name goes by the
female side, marriages between half-brothers and
half-sisters are permitted, as in ancient Athens and
among the Hebrews of Abraham&rsquo;s time. Once
more, the exogamous prohibition excludes, in China,
America, Africa, Australia, persons who are in no
way akin (according to our ideas) from intermarriage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
Thus Mr. Doolittle writes,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> &lsquo;Males and females of
the same surname will never intermarry in China.
Cousins who have not the same ancestral surname
may intermarry. Though the ancestors of persons
of the same surname have not known each other for
thousands of years, they may not intermarry.&rsquo; The
Hindoo <i>gotra</i> rule produces the same effects.</p>

<p>For all these reasons, and because of the improbability
of the physiological discovery, and of the moral
&lsquo;reform&rsquo; which enforced it; and again, because the
law is not of the sort which people acquainted with
near degrees of kinship would make; and once more
because the law fails to effect its presumed purpose,
while it does attain ends at which it does not aim&mdash;we
cannot accept Mr. Morgan&rsquo;s suggestion as to the origin
of exogamy. Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan did not live to publish
a subtle theory of the origin of exogamy, which he
had elaborated. In <i>Studies in Ancient History</i> he
hazarded a conjecture based on female infanticide:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>We believe the restrictions on marriage to be connected
with the practice in early times of female infanticide,
which rendering women scarce, led at once to polyandry
within the tribe, and the capturing of women from without....
Hence the cruel custom which, leaving the
primitive human hordes with very few young women of their
own, occasionally with none, and in any case seriously
disturbing the balance of the sexes within the hordes, forces
them to prey upon one another for wives. Usage, induced
by necessity, would in time establish a prejudice among
the tribes observing it, a prejudice strong as a principle of
religion&mdash;as every prejudice relating to marriage is apt to
be&mdash;against marrying women of their own stock.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>258]</a></span>
Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan describes his own hypothesis as &lsquo;a
suggestion thrown out at what it was worth.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> In
his later years, as we have said, he developed a very
subtle and ingenious theory of the origin of exogamy,
still connecting it with scarcity of women, but making
use of various supposed stages and processes in the
development of the law. That speculation remains
unpublished. To myself, the suggestion given in
<i>Studies in Ancient History</i> seems inadequate. I find
it difficult to conceive that the frequent habit of
stealing women should indispose men to marry the
native women they had at hand. That this indisposition
should grow into a positive law, and the infringement
of the law be regarded as a capital offence,
seems more inconceivable. My own impression
is, that exogamy may be connected with some early
superstition or idea of which we have lost the touch,
and which we can no longer explain.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Possibly it
may be only one form of the Totem taboo. You may
not marry a woman of your totem, as you may not
eat an animal of the species.</p>

<p>Thus far, the consideration of exogamy has thrown
no clear light on the main question&mdash;the question
whether the customs of civilised races contain relics
of female kinship. On Mr. Lewis Morgan&rsquo;s theory
of exogamy, that Aryan custom is unconnected with
female kinship, polyandry, and scarcity of women.
On Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan&rsquo;s theory, exogamy is the result of
scarcity of women, and implies polyandry and female
kinship. But neither theory has seemed satisfactory.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>259]</a></span>
Yet we need not despair of extracting some evidence
from exogamy, and that evidence, on the whole, is in
favour of Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan&rsquo;s general hypothesis. (1)
The exogamous prohibition must have first come into
force <em>when kinship was only reckoned on one side of the
family</em>. This is obvious, whether we suppose it to
have arisen in a society which reckoned by male or
by female kinship. In the former case, the law only
prohibits marriage with persons of the father&rsquo;s, in
the second case with persons of the mother&rsquo;s, family
name, and these only it recognises as kindred. (2)
Our second point is much more important. The
exogamous prohibition must first have come into
force <em>when kinship was so little understood that it
could best be denoted by the family name</em>. This would
be self-evident, if we could suppose the prohibition to
be intended to prevent marriages of relations.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Had
the authors of the prohibition been acquainted with
the nature of near kinships, they would simply (as we
do) have forbidden marriage between persons in those
degrees. The very nature of the prohibition, on the
other hand, shows that kinship was understood in a
manner all unlike our modern system. The limit of
kindred was everywhere the family name: a limit
which excludes many real kinsfolk and includes many
who are not kinsfolk at all. In Australia especially,
and in America, India, and Africa, to a slighter extent,
that definition of kindred by the family name actually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>260]</a></span>
includes alligators, smoke, paddy melons, rain, crayfish,
sardines, and what you please.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Will any one
assert, then, that people among whom the exogamous
prohibition arose were organised on the system of the
patriarchal family, which permits the nature of kinship
to be readily understood at a glance? Is it not
plain that the exogamous prohibition (confessedly
Aryan) must have arisen in a stage of culture when
ideas of kindred were confused, included kinship
with animals and plants, and were to us almost, if
not quite, unintelligible? It is even possible, as Mr.
M&lsquo;Lennan says,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> &lsquo;that the prejudice against marrying
women of the same group may have been established
<em>before the facts of blood relationship had made any deep
impression on the human mind</em>.&rsquo; How the exogamous
prohibition tends to confirm this view will next be
set forth in our consideration of <i>Totemism</i>.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The Evidence from Totemism.</i>&mdash;Totemism is the
name for the custom by which a stock (scattered
through many local tribes) claims descent from and
kindred with some plant, animal, or other natural
object. This object, of which the effigy is sometimes
worn as a badge or crest, members of the stock refuse
to eat. As a general rule, marriage is prohibited
between members of the stock&mdash;between all, that is,
who claim descent from the same object and wear
the same badge. The exogamous limit, therefore, is
denoted by the stock-name and crest, and kinship is
kinship in the wolf, bear, potato, or whatever other
object is recognised as the original ancestor. Finally,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>261]</a></span>
as a general rule, the stock-name is derived through
the mother, and where it is derived through the father
there are proofs that the custom is comparatively
modern. It will be acknowledged that this sort of
kindred, which is traced to a beast, bird, or tree, which
is recognised in every person bearing the same stock-name,
which is counted through females, and which
governs marriage customs, is not the sort of kindred
that would naturally arise among people regulated
on the patriarchal or monandrous family system.
Totemism, however, is a widespread institution prevailing
all over the north of the American continent,
also in Peru (according to Garcilasso de la Vega);
in Guiana (the negroes have brought it from the
African Gold Coast, where it is in full force, as it
also is among the Bechuanas); in India among Hos,
Garos, Kassos, and Oraons; in the South Sea Islands,
where it has left strong traces in Mangaia; in Siberia,
and especially in the great island continent of Australia.
The Semitic evidences for totemism (animal-worship,
exogamy, descent claimed through females)
are given by Professor Robertson Smith, in the
<i>Journal of Philology</i>, ix. 17, <i>Animal Worship and
Animal Tribes among the Arabs, and in the Old
Testament</i>. Many other examples of totemism might
be adduced (especially from Egypt), but we must
restrict ourselves to the following questions:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. What light is thrown on the original form of the
family by totemism? 2. Where we find survivals
of totemism among civilised races, may we conclude
that these races (through scarcity of women) had once
been organised on other than the patriarchal model?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
As to the first question, we must remember that
the origin and determining causes of totemism are still
unknown. Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan&rsquo;s theory of the origin of
totemism has never been published.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> It may be said
without indiscretion that Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan once thought
totemism arose at a period when ideas of kinship
scarcely existed at all. &lsquo;Men only thought of marking
one off from another,&rsquo; as Garcilasso de la Vega says:
the totem was but a badge worn by all the persons
who found themselves existing in close relations; perhaps
in the same cave or set of caves. People united
by contiguity, and by the blind sentiment of kinship
not yet brought into explicit consciousness, might
mark themselves by a badge, and might thence derive
a name, and, later, might invent a myth of their
descent from the object which the badge represented.
I do not know whether it has been observed that the
totems are, as a rule, objects which may be easily
drawn or tattooed, and still more easily indicated in
gesture-language. Some interesting facts will be
found in the <i>First Annual Report of the Bureau of
Ethnology</i>, p. 458 (Washington, 1881). Here we
read how the &lsquo;Crow&rsquo; tribe is indicated in sign-language
by &lsquo;the hands held out on each side, striking
the air in the manner of flying.&rsquo; The Bunaks (another
bird tribe) are indicated by an imitation of the cry
of the bird. In mentioning the Snakes, the hand
imitates the crawling motion of the serpent, and the
fingers pointed up behind the ear denote the Wolves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span>
Plainly names of the totem sort are well suited to the
convenience of savages, who converse much in gesture-language.
Above all, the very nature of totemism
shows that it took its present shape at a time when
men, animals, and plants were conceived of as physically
akin; when names were handed on through the
female line; when exogamy was the rule of marriage,
and when the family theoretically included all persons
bearing the same family name, that is, all who claimed
kindred with the same plant, animal, or object, whether
the persons are really akin or not. These ideas and
customs are not the ideas natural to men organised
in the patriarchal family.</p>

<p>The second question now arises: Can we infer
from survivals of totemism among Aryans that these
Aryans had once been organised on the full totemistic
principle, probably with polyandry, and certainly with
female descent? Where totemism now exists in full
force, there we find exogamy and derivation of the
family name through women, the latter custom indicating
uncertainty of male parentage in the past.
Are we to believe that the same institutions have
existed wherever we find survivals of totemism? If
this be granted, and if the supposed survivals of
totemism among Aryans be accepted as genuine,
then the Aryans have distinctly come through a
period of kinship reckoned through women, with all
that such an institution implies.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> For indications that
the Aryans of Greece and India have passed through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
the stage of totemism, the reader may be referred to
Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan&rsquo;s &lsquo;Worship of Plants and Animals&rsquo;
(<i>Fortnightly Review</i>, 1869, 1870). The evidence
there adduced is not all of the same value, and the
papers are only a hasty rough sketch based on the first
testimonies that came to hand. Probably the most important
&lsquo;survival&rsquo; of totemism in Greek legend is the
body of stories about the amours of Zeus in animal
form. Various noble houses traced their origin to
Zeus or Apollo, who, as a bull, tortoise, serpent, swan,
or ant, had seduced the mother of the race. The
mother of the Arcadians became a she-bear, like the
mother of the bear stock of the Iroquois. As we
know plenty of races all over the world who (like
Greek royal houses) trace their descent from serpents,
tortoises, swans, and so forth, it is a fair hypothesis
that the ancestors of the Greeks once believed in the
same fables. In later times the swan, serpent, ant,
or tortoise was explained as an <em>avatar</em> of Zeus. The
process by which an anthropomorphic god or hero
succeeds to the exploits of animals, of theriomorphic
gods and heroes, is the most common in mythology,
and is illustrated by actual practice in modern India.
When the Brahmins convert a pig-worshipping tribe
of aboriginals, they tell their proselytes that the pig
was an avatar of Vishnu. The same process is found
active where the Japanese have influenced the savage
Ainos, and persuaded them that their bear-&nbsp;or dog-father
was a manifestation of a deity. We know
from Plutarch (<i>Theseus</i>, vii. viii.) that one Carian
<ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>, the Ioxid&aelig;, revered the asparagus because it was
friendly to their ancestress, as a totem should be. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span>
vaguer indication of totemism may perhaps be detected
in the ancient theriomorphic statues of Greek gods,
as the Ram-Zeus and the Horse-headed Demeter, and
in the various animals and plants which were sacred
to each god and represented as his companions.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>The hints of totemism among the ancient Irish
are interesting. One hero, Conaire, was the son of a
bird, and before his birth his father (the bird) told
the woman (his mother) that the child must never
eat the flesh of fowls. &lsquo;Thy son shall be named
Conaire, and that son shall not kill birds.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The hero
Cuchullain, being named after the dog, might not eat
the flesh of the dog, and came by his ruin after transgressing
this totemistic taboo. Races named after
animals were common in ancient Ireland. The red-deer
and the wolves were tribes dwelling near Ossory,
and Professor Rhys, from the frequency of dog names,
inclines to believe in a dog totem in Erin. According
to the ancient Irish &lsquo;Wonders of Eri,&rsquo; in the <i>Book
of Glendaloch</i>, &lsquo;the descendants of the wolf are in
Ossory,&rsquo; and they could still transform themselves
into wolves.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> As to our Anglo-Saxon ancestors, there
is little evidence beyond the fact that the names (in
many cases patronymics) of the early settlements of
Billings, Arlings, and the rest, are undeniably derived
from animals and plants. The manner in
which those names are scattered locally is precisely
like what results in America, Africa, and Australia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
from the totemistic organisation.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> In Italy the ancient
custom by which animals were the leaders of the <i>Ver
sacrum</i> or armed migration is well known. The Piceni
had for their familiar animal or totem (if we may call
it so) a woodpecker; the Hirpini were like the &lsquo;descendants
of the wolf&rsquo; in Ossory, and practised a wolf-dance
in which they imitated the actions of the animal.</p>

<p>Such is a summary of the evidence which hints
that Aryans may once have been totemists, therefore
savages, and therefore, again, had probably been in a
stage when women were scarce and each woman had
many husbands.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Evidence from the Gens or <ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>.</i>&mdash;There is no
more puzzling topic in the history of the ancient world
than the origin and nature of the community called by
the Romans the <i>gens</i>, and by the Greeks the <ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>. To
the present writer it seems that no existing community
of men, neither totem kin, nor clan, nor house community,
nor <i>gotra</i>, precisely answers to the <i>gens</i> or
the <ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>. Our information about these forms of
society is slight and confused. The most essential
thing to notice for the moment is the fact that both in
Greece and Rome the <ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins> and <i>gens</i> were extremely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span>
ancient, so ancient that the <ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins> was decaying in
Greece when history begins, while in Rome we can
distinctly see the rapid decadence and dissolution
of the <i>gens</i>. In the laws of the Twelve Tables, the
<i>gens</i> is a powerful and respected corporation. In the
time of Cicero the nature of the <i>gens</i> is a matter but
dimly understood. Tacitus begins to be confused
about the gentile nomenclature. In the Empire
gentile law fades away. In Greece, especially at
Athens, the early political reforms transferred power
from the <ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins> to a purely local organisation, the
Deme. The Greek of historical times did not
announce his <ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins> in his name (as the Romans
always did), but gave his own name, that of his
father, and that of his deme. Thus we may infer
that in Greek and Roman society the <ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins> and <i>gens</i>
were dying, not growing, organisations. In very
early times it is probable that foreign <i>gentes</i> were
adopted <i>en bloc</i> into the Roman Commonwealth.
Very probably, too, a great family, on entering the
Roman bond, may have assumed, by a fiction, the
character and name of a <i>gens</i>. But that Roman
society in historical times, or that Greek society,
could evolve a new <i>gens</i> or <ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins> in a normal natural
way, seems excessively improbable.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind the antique and &lsquo;obsolescent&rsquo;
character of the <i>gens</i> and <ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>, let us examine the theories
of the origin of these associations. The Romans
themselves knew very little about the matter. Cicero
quotes the dictum of Sc&aelig;vola the Pontifex, according
to which the <i>gens</i> consisted of <em>all persons of the same
gentile name</em> who were not in any way disqualified.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>268]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_228_229" id="FNanchor_228_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_229" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
Thus, in America, or Australia, or Africa, all
persons bearing the same totem name belong to that
totem kin. Festus defines members of a <i>gens</i> as persons
of the same stock and same family name. Varro
says (in illustration of the relationships of words and
cases), &lsquo;Ab &AElig;milio homines orti &AElig;milii sunt gentiles.&rsquo;
The two former definitions answer to the conception
of a totem kin, which is united by its family name and
belief in identity of origin. Varro adds the element,
in the Roman <i>gens</i>, of common descent from one
male ancestor. Such was the conception of the <i>gens</i>
in historical times. It was in its way an association
of kinsfolk, real or supposed. According to the Laws
of the Twelve Tables the gentiles inherited the property
of an intestate man without agnates, and had
the custody of lunatics in the same circumstances.
The <i>gens</i> had its own <i>sacellum</i> or chapel, and its own
<i>sacra</i> or religious rites. The whole <i>gens</i> occasionally
went into mourning when one of its members was
unfortunate. It would be interesting if it could be
shown that the <i>sacra</i> were usually examples of ancestor-worship,
but the faint indications on the subject
scarcely permit us to assert this.</p>

<p>On the whole, Sir Henry Maine strongly clings to
the belief that the <i>gens</i> commonly had &lsquo;a real core of
agnatic consanguinity from the very first.&rsquo; But he
justly recognises the principle of imitation, which
induces men to copy any fashionable institution.
Whatever the real origin of the <i>gens</i>, many <i>gentes</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
were probably copies based on the fiction of common
ancestry.</p>

<p>On Sir Henry Maine&rsquo;s system, then, the <i>gens</i>
rather proves the constant existence of recognised
male descents among the peoples where it exists.<a name="FNanchor_229_230" id="FNanchor_229_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_230" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>The opposite theory of the <i>gens</i> is that to which
Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan inclined. &lsquo;The composition and
organisation of Greek and Roman tribes and commonwealths
cannot well be explained except on the
hypothesis that they resulted from the joint operation,
in early times, of exogamy, and the system of kinship
through females only.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_230_231" id="FNanchor_230_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_231" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> &lsquo;The <i>gens</i>,&rsquo; he adds, &lsquo;was
composed of all the persons in the tribe bearing the
same name and accounted of the same stock. Were
the <i>gentes</i> really of different stocks, as their names
would imply and as the people believed? If so, how
came clans of different stocks to be united in the
same tribe?... How came a variety of such groups,
of different stocks, to coalesce in a local tribe?&rsquo; These
questions, Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan thought, could not be
answered on the patriarchal hypothesis. His own
theory, or rather his theory as understood by the
present writer, may be stated thus. In the earliest
times there were homogeneous groups, which became
totem kin. Let us say that, in a certain district,
there were groups called woodpeckers, wolves, bears,
suns, swine, each with its own little territory. These
groups were exogamous, and derived the name through
the mother. Thus, in course of time, when sun men
married a wolf girl, and her children were wolves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span>
there would be wolves in the territory of the suns,
and thus each stock would be scattered through all
the localities, just as we see in Australia and America.
Let us suppose that (as certainly is occurring in
Australia and America) paternal descent comes to be
recognised in custom. This change will not surprise
Sir Henry Maine, who admits that a system of male
may alter, under stress of circumstances, to a system
of female descents. In course of time, and as knowledge
and common-sense advance, the old superstition
of descent from a woodpecker, a bear, a wolf, the sun,
or what not, becomes untenable. A human name
is assumed by the group which had called itself the
woodpeckers or the wolves, or perhaps by a local
tribe in which several of these stocks are included.
Then a fictitious human ancestor is adopted, and
perhaps even adored. Thus the wolves might call
themselves Claudii, from their chief&rsquo;s name, and, giving
up belief in descent from a wolf, might look back to
a fancied ancestor named Claudius. The result of
these changes will be that an exogamous totem kin,
with female descent, has become a <i>gens</i>, with male
kinship, and only the faintest trace of exogamy. An
example of somewhat similar processes must have
occurred in the Highland clans after the introduction
of Christianity, when the chief&rsquo;s Christian name
became the patronymic of the people who claimed
kinship with him and owned his sway.</p>

<p>Are there any traces at all of totemism in what
we know of the Roman <i>gentes</i>? Certainly the traces
are very slight; perhaps they are only visible to the
eye of the intrepid anthropologist. I give them for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
what they are worth, merely observing that they do
tally, as far as they go, with the totemistic theory.
The reader interested in the subject may consult
the learned Streinnius&rsquo;s <i>De Gentibus Romanis</i>, p. 104
(Aldus, Venice, 1591).</p>

<p>Among well-known savage totems none is more
familiar than the sun. Men claim descent from the
sun, call themselves by his name, and wear his effigy
as a badge.<a name="FNanchor_231_232" id="FNanchor_231_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_232" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Were there suns in Rome? The Aurelian
<i>gens</i> is thus described on the authority of Festus
Pompeius: &lsquo;The Aurelii were of Sabine descent.
The Aurelii were so named from the sun (<i>aurum</i>, <i>urere</i>,
the burning thing), because a place was set apart
for them in which to pay adoration to the sun.&rsquo;
Here, at least, is an odd coincidence. Among other
gentile names, the Fabii, Cornelii, Papirii, Pinarii,
Cassii, are possibly connected with plants; while wild
etymology may associate Porcii, Aquilii, and Valerii
with swine and eagles. Pliny (<i>H.&nbsp;N.</i>, xviii. 3) gives a
fantastic explanation of the vegetable names of Roman
<i>gentes</i>. We must remember that vegetable names are
very common in American, Indian, African, and
Australian totem kin. Of sun names the Natchez
and the Incas of Peru are familiar examples. Turning
from Rome to Greece, we find the <ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins> less regarded
and more decadent than the <i>gens</i>. Yet, according
to Grote (iii. 54) the <ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins> had&mdash;(1) <i>Sacra</i>, &lsquo;in honour
of the same god, supposed to be the primitive ancestor.&rsquo;
(2) A common burial-place. (3) Certain rights
of succession to property. (4) Obligations of mutual
help and defence. (5) Mutual rights and obligations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
to intermarry in certain cases. (6) Occasionally
possession of common property.</p>

<p>Traces of the totem among the Greek <ins class="greek" title="gen&ecirc;">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#951;</ins> are,
naturally, few. Almost all the known <ins class="greek" title="gen&ecirc;">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#951;</ins> bore
patronymics derived from personal names. But it is
not without significance that the Attic demes often
adopted the names of obsolescent <ins class="greek" title="gen&ecirc;">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#951;</ins>, and that deme
names were, as Mr. Grote says (iii. 63), often &lsquo;derived
from the plants and shrubs which grew in their neighbourhood.&rsquo;
We have already seen that at least one
ancient <ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>, the Ioxid&aelig;, revered the plant which,
as the myth ran, befriended their ancestress. One
thing is certain, the totem names, and a common explanation
of the totem names in Australia, correspond
with the names and Mr. Grote&rsquo;s explanation
of the names of the Attic demes. &lsquo;One origin
of family names,&rsquo; says Sir George Grey (ii. 228),
&lsquo;frequently ascribed by the natives, is that they
were derived from some vegetable or animal being
common in the district which the family inhabited.&rsquo;
Some writers attempt to show that the Attic <ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins>
was once exogamous and counted kin on the
mother&rsquo;s side, by quoting the custom which permitted
a man to marry his half-sister, the child of
his father but not of his mother. They infer that
this permission is a survival from the time when a
man&rsquo;s <em>father&rsquo;s</em> children were not reckoned as his
kindred, and when kinship was counted through
mothers. Sir Henry Maine (p. 105) prefers M. Fustel
de Coulanges&rsquo; theory, that the marriage of half-brothers
and sisters on the father&rsquo;s side was intended
to save the portion of the girl to the family estate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>273]</a></span>
Proof of this may be adduced from examination of
all the recorded cases of such marriages in Athens.
But the reason thus suggested would have equally
justified marriage between brothers and sisters on
both sides, and this was reckoned incest. A well-known
line in Aristophanes shows how intense was
Athenian feeling about the impiety of relations with
a sister uterine.</p>

<p>On the whole, the evidence which we have
adduced tends to establish some links between the
ancient <ins class="greek" title="genos">&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</ins> and <i>gens</i>, and the totem kindreds of
savages. The indications are not strong, but they all
point in one direction. Considering the high civilisation
of Rome and Greece at the very dawn of history&mdash;considering
the strong natural bent of these peoples
toward refinement&mdash;it is almost remarkable that even
the slight testimonies we have been considering should
have survived.</p>

<p>(5) On the evidence from myth and legend we
propose to lay little stress. But, as legends were not
invented by anthropologists to prove a point, it is odd
that the traditions of Athens, as preserved by Varro,
speak of a time when names were derived from the
mother, and when promiscuity prevailed. Marriage
itself was instituted by Cecrops, the serpent, just as
the lizard, in Australia, is credited with this useful
invention.<a name="FNanchor_232_233" id="FNanchor_232_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_233" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Similar legends among non-Aryan races,
Chinese and Egyptian, are very common.</p>

<p>(6) There remains the evidence of actual fact
and custom among Aryan peoples. The Lycians,
according to Herodotus, &lsquo;have this peculiar custom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
<em>wherein they resemble no other men</em>, they derive their
names from their mothers, and not from their fathers,
and through mothers reckon their kin.&rsquo; Status also
was derived through the mothers.<a name="FNanchor_233_234" id="FNanchor_233_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_234" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> The old writer&rsquo;s
opinion that the custom (so common in Australia,
America and Africa) was unique, is itself a proof of
his good faith. Bachofen (p. 390) remarks that several
Lycian inscriptions give the names of mothers only.
Polybius attributes (assigning a fantastic reason) the
same custom of counting kin through mothers to the
Locrians.<a name="FNanchor_234_235" id="FNanchor_234_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_235" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> The British and Irish custom of deriving
descents through women is well known,<a name="FNanchor_235_236" id="FNanchor_235_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_236" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> and a story
is told to account for the practice. The pedigrees of
the British kings show that most did not succeed to
their fathers, and the various records of early Celtic
morals go to prove that no other system of kinship
than the maternal would have possessed any value, so
uncertain was fatherhood. These are but hints of
the prevalence of institutions which survived among
Teutonic races in the importance attached to the
relationship of a man&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son. Though no longer
his legal heir, the sister&rsquo;s son was almost closer than
any other kinsman.<a name="FNanchor_236_237" id="FNanchor_236_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_237" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>We have now summarised and indicated the nature
of the evidence which, on the whole, inclines us to the
belief of Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan rather than of Sir Henry Maine.
The point to which all the testimony adduced converges,
the explanation which most readily solves all
the difficulties, is the explanation of Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
The Aryan races have very generally passed through
the stage of scarcity of women, polyandry, absence of
recognised male kinship, and recognition of kinship
through women. What Sir Henry Maine admits as
the exception, we are inclined to regard as having, in
a very remote past, been the rule. No one kind of
evidence&mdash;neither traces of marriage by capture, of
exogamy, of totemism, of tradition, of noted fact
among Lycians and Picts and Irish&mdash;would alone
suffice to guide our opinion in this direction. But
the cumulative force of the testimony strikes us as
not inconsiderable, and it must be remembered that
the testimony has not yet been assiduously collected.</p>

<p>Let us end by showing how this discussion illustrates
the method of Folklore. We have found
anomalies among Aryans. We have seen the <i>gens</i> an
odd, decaying institution. We have seen Greek families
claim descent from various animals, said to be Zeus,
or another god, in disguise. We have found them
tracing kinship and deriving names from the mother.
We have found stocks with animal and vegetable
names. We have found half-brothers and sisters
marrying. We have noted prohibitions to marry any
one of the same family name. All these institutions
are odd, anomalous, decaying things among Aryans,
and the more civilised the Aryans the more they decay.
All of them are living, active things among savages,
and, far from being anomalous, are in precise harmony
with savage notions of the world. Surely, then, where
they seem decaying and anomalous, as among Aryans,
these customs and laws are mouldering relics of ideas
and practices natural and inevitable among savages.</p>

Here I would like to point out that Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan&rsquo;s theory was
not so hard and fast as his manner (that of a very assured believer in
his own ideas) may lead some inquirers to suppose. Sir Henry Maine
writes, that both Mr. Morgan and Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan &lsquo;seem to me to
think that human society went everywhere through the same series of
changes, and Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan, at any rate, expresses himself as if all
those stages could be clearly discriminated from one another, and the
close of one and the commencement of another announced with the
distinctness of the clock-bell telling the end of the hour.&rsquo; On the
other hand, I remember Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan&rsquo;s saying that, in his opinion,
&lsquo;all manner of arrangements probably went on simultaneously in different
places.&rsquo; In <i>Studies in Ancient History</i>, p. 127, he expressly
guards against the tendency &lsquo;to assume that the progress of the various
races of men from savagery has been a uniform progress: that all the
stages which any of them has gone through have been passed in their
order by all.&rsquo; Still more to the point is his remark on polyandry
among the very early Greeks and other Aryans; &lsquo;it is quite consistent
with my view that in all these quarters (Persia, Sparta, Troy, Lycia,
Attica, Crete, etc.) monandry, and even the <i>patria potestas</i>, may have
prevailed at points.&rsquo;</p>

We do not, however, make this presumption. Considering what
sort of affair truly <em>primitive</em> marriage must have been, there may
have risen a prejudice against it within the group. Any one acquainted

Mr. Grant Allen kindly supplied me some time ago with a list of
animal and vegetable names preserved in the titles of ancient English
village settlements. Among them are: ash, birch, bear (as among
the Iroquois), oak, buck, fir, fern, sun, wolf, thorn, goat, horse,
salmon (the trout is a totem in America), swan (familiar in Australia),
and others. It may be argued, as by Mr. Isaac Taylor, that such
names, in England, merely described local characteristics, though, in
Asia, India, Africa, Australia, Samoa, Egypt, similar names are derived
from totemism.</p>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14"></a><i>THE ART OF SAVAGES.</i><a name="FNanchor_237_238" id="FNanchor_237_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_238" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></h2>


<p>&lsquo;Avoid Coleridge, he is <em>useless</em>,&rsquo; says Mr. Ruskin.
Why should the poetry of Coleridge be useful? The
question may interest the critic, but we are only concerned
with Mr. Ruskin here, for one reason. His
disparagement of Coleridge as &lsquo;useless&rsquo; is a survival
of the belief that art should be &lsquo;useful.&rsquo; This is the
savage&rsquo;s view of art. He imitates nature, in dance,
song, or in plastic art, for a definite practical purpose.
His dances are magical dances, his images are made
for a magical purpose, his songs are incantations. Thus
the theory that art is a disinterested expression of the
imitative faculty is scarcely warranted by the little we
know of art&rsquo;s beginnings. We shall adopt, provisionally,
the hypothesis that the earliest art with which
we are acquainted is that of savages contemporary
or extinct. Some philosophers may tell us that all
known savages are only degraded descendants of
early civilised men who have, unluckily and inexplicably,
left no relics of their civilisation. But we
shall argue on the opposite theory, that the art of Australians,
for example, is really earlier in kind, more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
backward, nearer the rude beginnings of things, than
the art of people who have attained to some skill in
pottery, like the New Caledonians. These, again, are
much more backward, in a state really much earlier,
than the old races of Mexico and Peru; while they,
in turn, show but a few traces of advance towards the
art of Egypt; and the art of Egypt, at least after the
times of the Ancient Empire, is scarcely advancing in
the direction of the flawless art of Greece. We shall
be able to show how savage art, as of the Australians,
develops into barbarous art, as of the New Zealanders;
while the arts of strange civilisations, like those of
Peru and Mexico, advance one step further; and how,
again, in the early art of Greece, in the Greek art of
ages prior to Pericles, there are remains of barbaric
forms which are gradually softened into beauty. But
there are necessarily breaks and solutions of continuity
in the path of progress.</p>

<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 1.&mdash;An Australian Shield.</p>

<p>One of the oldest problems has already risen before
us in connection with the question stated: Is art the
gratification of the imitative faculty? Now, among
the lowest, the most untutored, the worst equipped
savages of contemporary races, art is rather decorative
on the whole than imitative. The patterns on
Australian shields and clubs, the scars which they
raise on their own flesh by way of tattooing, are very
rarely imitations of any objects in nature. The
Australians, like the Red Indians, like many African
and some aboriginal Indian races, Peruvians, and
others, distinguish their families by the names of
various plants and animals, from which each family
boasts its descent. Thus you have a family called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
Kangaroos, descended, as they fancy, from the kangaroo;
another from the cockatoo, another from the
black snake, and so forth. Now, in many quarters
of the globe, this custom and this superstition, combined
with the imitative faculty in man, has produced
a form of art representing the objects from which the
families claim descent. This art is a sort of rude
heraldry&mdash;probably the origin of heraldry. Thus, if
a Red Indian (say a Delaware) is of the family of
the Turtle, he blazons a turtle on his shield or coat,
probably tattoos or paints his breast with a figure of a
turtle, and always has a turtle, <em>reversed</em>, designed on
the pillar above his grave when he dies, just as, in
our medi&aelig;val chronicles, the leopards of an English
king are reversed on his scutcheon opposite the
record of his death. But the Australians, to the best
of my knowledge, though they are much governed by
belief in descent from animals, do not usually blazon
their crest on their flesh, nor on the trees near the
place where the dead are buried. They have not
arrived at this pitch of imitative art, though they
have invented or inherited a kind of runes which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span>
notch on sticks, and in which they convey to each
other secret messages. The natives of the Upper
Darling, however, do carve their family crests on
their shields. In place of using imitative art, the
Murri are said, I am not quite sure with what truth,
to indicate the distinction of families by arrangements
of patterns, lines and dots, tattooed on the breast and
arms, and carved on the bark of trees near places of
burial. In any case, the absence of the rude imitative
art of heraldry among a race which possesses all
the social conditions that produce this art is a fact
worth noticing, and itself proves that the native art
of one of the most backward races we know is not
essentially imitative.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 2.</p>

<p>Any one who will look through a collection of
Australian weapons and utensils will be brought
to this conclusion. The shields and the clubs are
elaborately worked, but almost always without any
representation of plants, animals, or the human
figure. As a rule the decorations take the simple
shape of the &lsquo;herring-bone&rsquo; pattern, or such other
patterns as can be produced without the aid of
spirals, or curves, or circles. There is a natural and
necessary cause of this choice of decoration. The
Australians, working on hard wood, with tools made
of flint, or broken glass, or sharp shell, cannot easily
produce any curved lines. Every one who, when a
boy, carved his name on the bark of a tree, remembers
the difficulty he had with S and G, while
he got on easily with letters like M and A, which
consist of straight or inclined lines. The savage
artist has the same difficulty with his rude tools in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"><!-- original location of Fig. 2 --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>281]</a></span>
producing anything like satisfactory curves or spirals.
We engrave above (<a href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>) a shield on which an
Australian has succeeded, with obvious difficulty, in
producing concentric ovals of irregular shape. It may
be that the artist would have produced perfect circles
if he could. His failure is exactly like that of a
youthful carver of inscriptions coming to grief over
his G&rsquo;s and S&rsquo;s. Here, however (<a href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>), we have three
shields which, like the ancient Celtic pipkin (the
tallest of the three figures in <a href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>), show the earliest
known form of savage decorative art&mdash;the forms
which survive under the names of &lsquo;chevron&rsquo; and
&lsquo;herring-bone.&rsquo; These can be scratched on clay with
the nails, or a sharp stick, and this primeval way of
decorating pottery made without the wheel survives,
with other relics of savage art, in the western isles of
Scotland. The Australian had not even learned to
make rude clay pipkins, but he decorated his shields
as the old Celts and modern old Scotch women
decorated their clay pots, with the herring-bone
arrangement of incised lines. In the matter of
colour the Australians prefer white clay and red
ochre, which they rub into the chinks in the woodwork
of their shields. When they are determined on
an ambush, they paint themselves all over with white,
justly conceiving that their sudden apparition in this
guise will strike terror into the boldest hearts. But
arrangements in black and white of this sort scarcely
deserve the name of even rudimentary art.</p>

<p>The Australians sometimes introduce crude decorative
attempts at designing the human figure, as
in the pointed shield opposite (<a href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>, <i>a</i>), which, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"><!-- original location of Fig. 3 --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>283]</a></span>
the other Australian designs, are from Mr. Brough
Smyth&rsquo;s <i>Aborigines of Victoria</i>. But these ambitious
efforts usually end in failure.
Though the Australians chiefly
confine themselves to decorative
art, there are numbers of wall-paintings,
so to speak, in the
caves of the country which prove
that they, like the Bushmen,
could design the human figure in
action when they pleased. Their
usual preference for the employment
of patterns appears to me
to be the result of the nature of
their materials. In modern art
our mechanical advantages and
facilities are so great that we
are always carrying the method
and manner of one art over the
frontier of another. Our poetry
aims at producing the effects of
music; our prose at producing
the effects of poetry. Our sculpture
tries to vie with painting in
the representation of action, or
with lace-making in the production
of reticulated surfaces, and
so forth. But the savage, in his
art, has sense enough to confine
himself to the sort of work for
which his materials are fitted. Set him in the bush
with no implements and materials but a bit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>284]</a></span>
broken shell and a lump of hard wood, and he
confines himself to decorative scratches. Place the
black in the large cave which Pundjel, the Australian
Zeus, inhabited when on earth (as Zeus inhabited the
cave in Crete), and give the black plenty of red and
white ochre and charcoal, and he will paint the
human figure in action on the rocky walls. Later,
we will return to the cave-paintings of the Australians
and the Bushmen in South Africa. At present we
must trace purely decorative art a little further. But
we must remember that there was once a race apparently
in much the same social condition as the Australians,
but far more advanced and ingenious in art.
The earliest men of the European Continent, about
whom we know much, the men whose bones and
whose weapons are found beneath the gravel-drift,
the men who were contemporary with the rhinoceros,
mammoth and cave-bear, were not further advanced
in material civilisation than the Australians. They
used weapons of bone, of unpolished stone, and
probably of hard wood. But the remnants of their
art, the scraps of mammoth or reindeer bone in our
museums, prove that they had a most spirited style
of sketching from the life. In a collection of drawings
on bone (probably designed with a flint or a
shell), drawings by pal&aelig;olithic man, in the British
Museum, I have only observed one purely decorative
attempt. Even in this the decoration resembles an
effort to use the outlines of foliage for ornamental
purposes. In almost all the other cases the pal&aelig;olithic
artist has not decorated his bits of bone in the
usual savage manner, but has treated his bone as an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
artist treats his sketch-book, and has scratched outlines
of beasts and fishes with his sharp shell as an
artist uses his point. These ancient bones, in short,
are the sketch-books of European savages, whose
untaught skill was far greater than that of the Australians,
or even of the Eskimo. When brought into
contact with Europeans, the Australian and Eskimo
very quickly, even without regular teaching, learn to
draw with some spirit and skill. In the Australian
stele, or grave-pillar, which we have engraved (<a href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>),
the shapeless figures below the men and animals are the
dead, and the <i>boilyas</i> or ghosts. Observe the patterns
in the interstices. The artist had lived with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>286]</a></span>
Europeans. In their original conditions, however, the
Australians have not attained to such free, artist-like,
and unhampered use of their rude materials as the
mysterious European artists who drew the mammoth
that walked abroad amongst them.</p>

<p>We have engraved one solitary Australian attempt
at drawing curved lines. The New Zealanders, a
race far more highly endowed, and, when Europeans
arrived amongst them, already far more civilised than
the Australians, had, like the Australians, no metal
implements. But their stone weapons were harder
and keener, and with these they engraved the various
spirals and coils on hard wood, of which we give
examples here. It is sometimes said that New
Zealand culture and art have filtered from some
Asiatic source, and that in the coils and spirals
designed, as in our engravings, on the face of the
Maori chief, or on his wooden furniture, there may be
found debased Asiatic influences.<a name="FNanchor_238_239" id="FNanchor_238_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_239" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> This is one of the
questions which we can hardly deal with here. Perhaps
its solution requires more of knowledge, anthropological
and linguistic, than is at present within the
reach of any student. Assuredly the races of the
earth have wandered far, and have been wonderfully
intermixed, and have left the traces of their
passage here and there on sculptured stones, and in
the keeping of the ghosts that haunt ancient grave-steads.
But when two pieces of artistic work, one
civilised, one savage, resemble each other, it is always
dangerous to suppose that the resemblance bears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
witness to relationship or contact between the races,
or to influences imported by one from the other.
New Zealand work may be Asiatic in origin, and
debased by the effect of centuries of lower civilisation
and ruder implements. Or Asiatic ornament
may be a form of art improved out of ruder forms,
like those to which the New Zealanders have already
attained. One is sometimes almost tempted to regard
the favourite Maori spiral as an
imitation of the form, not unlike
that of a bishop&rsquo;s crozier at the
top, taken by the great native
ferns. Examples of resemblance,
to be accounted for by
the development of a crude early
idea, may be traced most easily
in the early pottery of Greece.
No one says that the Greeks
borrowed from the civilised
people of America. Only a
few enthusiasts say that the
civilised peoples of America, especially the Peruvians,
are Aryan by race. Yet the remains of Peruvian
palaces are often by no means dissimilar in style from
the &lsquo;Pelasgic&rsquo; and &lsquo;Cyclopean&rsquo; buildings of gigantic
stones which remain on such ancient Hellenic sites
as Argos and Mycen&aelig;. The probability is that men
living in similar social conditions, and using similar
implements, have unconsciously and unintentionally
arrived at like results.</p>

<p>Few people who are interested in the question
can afford to visit Peru and Mycen&aelig; and study
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>288]</a></span>
the architecture for themselves. But any one who
is interested in the strange identity of the human
mind everywhere, and in the necessary forms of early
art, can go to the British Museum and examine the
American and early Greek pottery. Compare the
Greek key pattern and the wave pattern on Greek and
Mexican vases, and compare the bird faces, or human
faces very like those of birds, with the similar faces
on the clay pots which Dr. Schliemann dug up at
Troy. The latter are engraved in his book on Troy.
Compare the so-called &lsquo;cuttle-fish&rsquo; from a Peruvian
jar with the same figure on the early Greek vases,
most of which are to be found in the last of the
classical vase-rooms upstairs. Once more, compare
the little clay &lsquo;whorls&rsquo; of the Mexican and Peruvian
room with those which Dr. Schliemann found so
numerous at Hissarlik. The conviction becomes
irresistible that all these objects, in shape, in purpose,
in character of decoration, are the same, because the
mind and the materials of men, in their early stages
of civilisation especially, are the same everywhere.
You might introduce old Greek bits of clay-work,
figures or vases, into a Peruvian collection, or might
foist Mexican objects among the clay treasures of
Hissarlik, and the wisest arch&aelig;ologist would be
deceived. The Greek fret pattern especially seems
to be one of the earliest that men learnt to draw.
The <i>svastika</i>, as it is called, the cross with lines at
right angles to each limb, is found everywhere&mdash;in
India, Greece, Scotland, Peru&mdash;as a natural bit of
ornament. The allegorising fancy of the Indians
gave it a mystic meaning, and the learned have built
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>289]</a></span>
I know not what worlds of religious theories on this
&lsquo;pre-Christian cross,&rsquo; which is probably a piece of
hasty decorative work, with no original mystic meaning
at all.<a name="FNanchor_239_240" id="FNanchor_239_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_240" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Ornaments of this sort were transferred from
wood or bone to clay, almost as soon as people learned
that early art, the potter&rsquo;s, to which the Australians
have not attained, though it was familiar to the not
distant people of New Caledonia. The style of
spirals and curves, again, once acquired (as it was by
the New Zealanders), became the favourite of some
races, especially of the Celtic. Any one who will
study either the ornaments of Mycen&aelig;, or those of
any old Scotch or Irish collection, will readily
recognise in that art the development of a system of
ornament like that of the Maoris. Classical Greece,
on the other hand, followed more in the track of the
ancient system of straight and slanted lines, and we
do not find in the later Greek art that love of interlacing
coils and spirals which is so remarkable among
the Celts, and which is very manifest in the ornaments
of the Mycen&aelig;an hoards&mdash;that is, perhaps, of
the ancient Greek heroic age. The causes of these
differences in the development of ornament, the
causes that made Celtic genius follow one track, and
pursue to its &aelig;sthetic limits one early <i>motif</i>, while
classical art went on a severer line, it is, perhaps,
impossible at present to ascertain. But it is plain
enough that later art has done little more than
develop ideas of ornament already familiar to untutored
races.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>290]</a></span>
It has been shown that the art which aims at
decoration is better adapted to both the purposes
and materials of savages than the art which aims at
representation. As a rule, the materials of the lower
savages are their own bodies (which they naturally
desire to make beautiful for ever by tattooing), and
the hard substances of which they fashion their tools
and weapons. These hard substances, when worked
on with cutting instruments of stone or shell, are
most easily adorned with straight cut lines, and
spirals are therefore found to be, on the whole, a
comparatively late form of ornament.</p>

<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 7.&mdash;Bushman Dog.</p>

<p>We have now to discuss the efforts of the savage
to represent. Here, again, we have to consider the
purpose which animates him, and the materials which
are at his service. His pictures have a practical
purpose, and do not spring from what we are apt,
perhaps too hastily, to consider the innate love of
imitation for its own sake. In modern art, in modern
times, no doubt the desire to imitate nature, by painting
or sculpture, has become almost an innate impulse,
an in-born instinct. But there must be some
&lsquo;reason why&rsquo; for this; and it does not seem at all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>291]</a></span>
unlikely that we inherit the love, the disinterested
love, of imitative art from very remote ancestors,
whose habits of imitation had a direct, interested and
practical purpose. The member of Parliament who
mimics the crowing of a cock during debate, or the
street boy who beguiles his leisure by barking like a
dog, has a disinterested pleasure in the exercise of his
skill; but advanced thinkers seem pretty well agreed
that the first men who imitated the voices of dogs,
and cocks, and other animals, did not do so merely
for fun, but with the practical purpose of indicating
to their companions the approach of these creatures.
Such were the rude beginnings of human language;
and whether that theory be correct or not, there are
certainly practical reasons which impel the savage to
attempt imitative art. I doubt if there are many
savage races which do not use representative art for the
purposes of writing&mdash;that is, to communicate information
to persons whom they cannot reach by the voice,
and to assist the memory, which, in a savage, is perhaps
not very strong. To take examples. A savage man
meets a savage maid. She does not speak his language,
nor he hers. How are they to know whether,
according to the marriage laws of their race, they are
lawful mates for each other? This important question
is settled by an inspection of their tattooed
marks. If a Thlinkeet man of the Swan stock meets
an Iroquois maid of the Swan stock they cannot
speak to each other, and the &lsquo;gesture-language&rsquo; is
cumbrous. But if both are tattooed with the swan,
then the man knows that this daughter of the
swan is not for him. He could no more marry her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>292]</a></span>
than Helen of Troy could have married Castor, the
tamer of horses. Both are children of the Swan, as
were Helen and Castor, and must regard each other
as brother and sister. The case of the Thlinkeet man
and the Iroquois maid is extremely unlikely to occur;
but I give it as an example of the practical use, among
savages, of representative art.</p>

<p>Among the uses of art for conveying intelligence
we notice that even the Australians have what the
Greeks would have called the <ins class="greek" title="skytal&ecirc;">&#963;&#954;&#965;&#964;&#8049;&#955;&#951;</ins>, a staff on
which inscriptions, legible to the Aborigines, are
engraven. I believe, however, that the Australian
<ins class="greek" title="skytal&ecirc;">&#963;&#954;&#965;&#964;&#8049;&#955;&#951;</ins> is not usually marked with picture-writing
but with notches&mdash;even more difficult to decipher.
As an example of Red Indian picture-writing we
publish a scroll from Kohl&rsquo;s book on the natives of
North America. This rude work of art, though the
reader may think little of it, is really a document
as important in its way as the Chald&aelig;an clay tablets
inscribed with the record of the Deluge. The
coarsely-drawn figures recall, to the artist&rsquo;s mind,
much of the myth of Manabozho, the Prometheus
and the Deucalion, the Cain and the Noah of the
dwellers by the great lake. Manabozho was a great
chief, who had two wives that quarrelled. The two
stumpy half-figures (4) represent the wives; the
mound between them is the displeasure of Manabozho.
Further on (5) you see him caught up between two
trees&mdash;an unpleasant fix, from which the wolves and
squirrels refused to extricate him. The kind of pyramid
with a figure at top (8) is a mountain, on which,
when the flood came, Manabozho placed his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"><!-- original location of Fig. 8 --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>294]</a></span>
grandmother to be out of the water&rsquo;s way. The somewhat
similar object is Manabozho himself, on the top of his
mountain. The animals you next behold (10) were
sent out by Manabozho to ascertain how the deluge
was faring, and to carry messages to his grandmother.
This scroll was drawn, probably on birch bark, by a
Red Man of literary attainments, who gave it to Kohl
(in its lower right-hand corner (11) he has pictured the
event), that he might never forget the story of the
Manabozhian deluge. The Red Indians have always,
as far as European knowledge goes, been in the habit
of using this picture-writing for the purpose of retaining
their legends, poems, and incantations. It is
unnecessary to say that the picture-writing of Mexico
and the hieroglyphics of ancient Egypt are derived
from the same savage processes. I must observe
that the hasty indications of the figure used in picture-writing
are by no means to be regarded as
measures of the Red Men&rsquo;s skill in art. They can
draw much better than the artist who recorded the
Manabozhian legend, when they please.</p>

<p>In addition to picture-writing, Religion has fostered
savage representative art. If a man worships a lizard
or a bear, he finds it convenient to have an amulet
or idol representing a bear or a lizard. If one adores
a lizard or a bear, one is likely to think that prayer
and acts of worship addressed to an image of the
animal will please the animal himself, and make him
propitious. Thus the art of making little portable
figures of various worshipful beings is fostered, and
the craft of working in wood or ivory is born. As a
rule, the savage is satisfied with excessively rude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"><!-- original location of Fig. 9 --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>296]</a></span>
representations of his gods. Objects of this kind&mdash;rude
hewn blocks of stone and wood&mdash;were the most sacred
effigies of the gods in Greece, and were kept in the
dimmest recesses of the temple. No Demeter wrought
by the craft of Phidias would have appeared so holy
to the Phigalians as the strange old figure of the goddess
with the head of a mare. The earliest Greek
sacred sculptures that remain are scarcely, if at all,
more advanced in art than the idols of the naked
Admiralty Islanders. But this is anticipating; in the
meantime it may be said that among the sources of
savage representative art are the need of something
like writing, and ideas suggested by nascent religion.</p>

<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 9.&mdash;Bushman Wall-painting.</p>

<p>The singular war-picture (<a href="#fig09">Fig. 9</a>) from a cave in
South Africa, which we copy from the <i>Cape Monthly
Magazine</i>, probably represents a magical ceremony.
Bushmen are tempting a great water animal&mdash;a
rhinoceros, or something of that sort&mdash;to run across
the land, for the purpose of producing rain. The
connection of ideas is scarcely apparent to civilised
minds, but it is not more indistinct than the connection
between carrying a bit of the rope with which a
man has been hanged and success at cards&mdash;a common
French superstition. The Bushman cave-pictures,
like those of Australia, are painted in black, red,
and white. Savages, like the Assyrians and the early
Greeks, and like children, draw animals much better
than the human figure. The Bushman dog in our little
engraving (<a href="#fig07">Fig. 7</a>) is all alive&mdash;almost as full of life as
the dog which accompanies the centaur Chiron, in that
beautiful vase in the British Museum which represents
the fostering of Achilles. The Bushman wall-paintings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>297]</a></span>
like those of Australia, seem to prove that savage art
is capable of considerable
freedom, when
supplied with fitting
materials. Men seem
to draw better when
they have pigments
and a flat surface of
rock to work upon,
than when they are
scratching on hard
wood with a sharp
edge of a broken
shell. Though the
thing has little to do
with art, it may be
worth mentioning, as
a matter of curiosity,
that the labyrinthine
Australian caves are
decorated, here and
there, with the mark
of a red hand. The
same mysterious, or
at least unexplained,
red hand is impressed
on the walls of the
ruined palaces and
temples of Yucatan&mdash;the
work of a vanished
people.</p>

<p>There is one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>298]</a></span>
singular fact in the history of savage art which reminds
us that savages, like civilised men, have various degrees
of culture and various artistic capacities. The
oldest inhabitants of Europe who have left any traces
of their lives and handiwork must have been savages.
Their tools and weapons were not even formed of
polished stone, but of rough-hewn flint. The people
who used tools of this sort must necessarily have
enjoyed but a scanty mechanical equipment, and the
life they lived in
caves from which
they had to drive
the cave-bear, and
among snows where
they stalked the
reindeer and the
mammoth, must
have been very
rough. These earliest
known Europeans,
&lsquo;pal&aelig;olithic
men,&rsquo; as they are
called, from their
use of the ancient unpolished stone weapons, appear
to have inhabited the countries now known as France
and England, before the great Age of Ice. This
makes their date one of incalculable antiquity; they
are removed from us by a &lsquo;dark backward and abysm
of time.&rsquo; The whole Age of Ice, the dateless period
of the polishers of stone weapons, the arrival of men
using weapons of bronze, the time which sufficed to
change the climate and fauna and flora of Western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>299]</a></span>
Europe, lie between us and pal&aelig;olithic man. Yet
in him we must recognise
a skill more
akin to the spirit of
modern art than is
found in any other
savage race. Pal&aelig;olithic
man, like other
savages, decorated his
weapons; but, as I
have already said, he
did not usually decorate
them in the
common savage manner
with ornamental
patterns. He scratched
on bits of bone
spirited representations
of all the animals
whose remains
are found mixed with
his own. He designed
the large-headed horse
of that period, and
science inclines to
believe that he drew
the breed correctly.
His sketches of the
mammoth, the reindeer,
the bear, and of
many fishes, may be
seen in the British Museum, or engraved in such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>300]</a></span>
works as Professor Boyd Dawkins&rsquo;s <i>Early Man in
Britain</i>. The object from which our next illustration
(<a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>) was engraved represents a deer, and was
a knife-handle. Eyes at all trained in art can readily
observe the wonderful spirit and freedom of these
ancient sketches. They are the rapid characteristic
work of true artists who know instinctively what to
select and what to sacrifice.</p>

<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 13.&mdash;Eskimo Drawing: a Reindeer Hunt.</p>

<p>Some learned men, Mr. Boyd Dawkins among
them, believe that the Eskimo, that stunted hunting
and fishing race of the Western Arctic circle, are descendants
of the pal&aelig;olithic sketchers, and retain their
artistic qualities. Other inquirers, with Mr. Geikie
and Dr. Wilson, do not believe in this pedigree
of the Eskimo. I speak not with authority, but
the submission of ignorance, and as one who has no
right to an opinion about these deep matters of geology
and ethnology. But to me, Mr. Geikie&rsquo;s arguments
appear distinctly the more convincing, and I cannot
think it demonstrated that the Eskimo are descended
from our old pal&aelig;olithic artists. But if Mr. Boyd
Dawkins is right, if the Eskimo derive their lineage
from the artists of the Dordogne, then the Eskimo are
sadly degenerated. In Mr. Dawkins&rsquo;s <i>Early Man</i> is
an Eskimo drawing of a reindeer hunt, and a pal&aelig;olithic
sketch of a reindeer; these (by permission
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>301]</a></span>
of the author and Messrs. Macmillan) we reproduce.
Look at the vigour and life of the ancient
drawing&mdash;the feathering hair on the deer&rsquo;s breast, his
head, his horns, the very grasses at his feet, are touched
with the graver of a true artist (<a href="#fig14">Fig. 14</a>). The design is
like a hasty memorandum of Leech&rsquo;s. Then compare
the stiff formality of the modern Eskimo drawing (<a href="#fig13">Fig.
13</a>). It is rather like a record, a piece of picture-writing,
than a free sketch, a rapid representation of what is
most characteristic in nature. Clearly, if the Eskimo
come from pal&aelig;olithic man, they are a degenerate
race as far as art is concerned. Yet, as may be seen
in Dr. Rink&rsquo;s books, the Eskimo show considerable
skill when they have become acquainted with European
methods and models, and they have at any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>302]</a></span>
rate a greater natural gift for design than the Red
Indians, of whose sacred art the Thunder-bird brooding
over page 298 is a fair example. The Red Men believe
in big birds which produce thunder. Quahteaht, the
Adam of Vancouver&rsquo;s Island, married one, and this

<p>We have tried to show how savage decorative art
supplied the first ideas of patterns which were developed
in various ways by the decorative art of advancing
civilisation. The same progress might be detected in
representative art. Books, like the guide-book to
ancient Greece which Pausanias wrote before the glory
had quite departed, prove that the Greek temples were
museums in which the development of art might be
clearly traced. Furthest back in the series of images
of gods came things like that large stone which was
given to Cronus when he wished to swallow his infant
child Zeus, and which he afterwards vomited up with
his living progeny. This fetich-stone was preserved
at Delphi. Next came wild bulks of beast-headed
gods, like the horse-headed Demeter of Phigalia, and
it seems possible enough that there was an Artemis
with the head of a she-bear. Gradually the bestial
characteristics dropped, and there appeared such rude
anthropomorphic images of Apollo&mdash;more like South
Sea idols than the archer prince&mdash;as are now preserved
in Athens. Next we have the stage of semi-savage
realism, which is represented by the metopes
of Selinus in Sicily, now in the British Museum, and
by not a few gems and pieces of gold work. Greek
temples have fallen, and the statues of the gods exist
only in scattered fragments. But in the representative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>303]</a></span>
collection of casts belonging to the Cambridge Arch&aelig;ological
Museum, one may trace the career of Greek
art backwards from Phidias to the rude idol.</p>

<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 15.&mdash;Archaic Greek Gems.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Savage realism&rsquo; is the result of a desire to represent
an object as it is known to be, and not as it
appears. Thus Catlin, among the Red Indians, found
that the people refused to be drawn in profile. They
knew they had two eyes, and in profile they seemed
only to have one. Look at the Selinus marbles, and
you will observe that figures, of which the body is
seen in profile, have the full face turned to the spectator.
Again, the savage knows that an animal has
two sides; both, he thinks, should be represented, but
he cannot foreshorten, and he finds the profile view
easiest to draw. To satisfy his need of realism he
draws a beast&rsquo;s head full-face, and gives to the one
head two bodies drawn in profile. Examples of this
are frequent in very archaic Greek gems and gold
work, and Mr. A.&nbsp;S. Murray suggests (as I understand
him) that the attitude of the two famous lions,
which guarded vainly Agamemnon&rsquo;s gate at Mycen&aelig;,
is derived from the archaic double-bodied and single-headed
beast of savage realism. Very good examples
of these oddities may be found in the <i>Journal
of the Hellenic Society</i>, 1881, pl. xv. Here are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>304]</a></span>
double-bodied and single-headed birds, monsters, and
sphinxes. We engrave (<a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a>) three Greek gems from
the islands as examples of savagery in early Greek art.
In the oblong gem the archers are rather below the
Red Indian standard of design. The hunter figured
in the first gem is almost up to the Bushman mark.
In his dress ethnologists will recognise an arrangement
now common among the natives of New Caledonia.
In the third gem the woman between two
swans may be Leda, or she may represent Leto in
Delos. Observe the amazing rudeness of the design,
and note the modern waist and crinoline. The
artists who engraved these gems on hard stone had,
of necessity, much better tools than any savages
possess, but their art was truly savage. To discover
how Greek art climbed in a couple of centuries from
this coarse and childish work to the grace of the
&AElig;gina marbles, and thence to the absolute freedom
and perfect unapproachable beauty of the work of
Phidias, is one of the most singular problems in the
history of art. Greece learned something, no doubt,
from her early knowledge of the arts the priests of
Assyria and Egypt had elaborated in the valleys of
the Euphrates and the Nile. That might account
for a swift progress from savage to formal and hieratic
art; but whence sprang the inspiration which led
her so swiftly on to art that is perfectly free, natural,
and god-like? It is a mystery of race, and of a
divine gift. &lsquo;The heavenly gods have given it to
mortals.&rsquo;</p>
